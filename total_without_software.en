Metabolic syndrome &#91; MetS &#93; is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities , characterized as central obesity , dysglycemia , raised blood pressure , elevated triglyceride &#91; TG &#93; level , and low high - density lipoprotein cholesterol &#91; HDL - C &#93; level . MetS is associated with cardiovascular disease , type 2 diabetes morbidity and mortality , and all - cause mortality . It is alarming that the prevalence of MetS is high and increasing in both developing and developed nations .
Thus , early identification and treatment of individuals with MetS is essential to prevent the adverse consequences related to its development . However , the diagnostic criteria of MetS are complex to conduct , which makes early identification of individuals with MetS challenging . Of these components of MetS , central obesity is considered as the most important component .

Most maternal deaths due to postpartum hemorrhage &#91; PPH &#93; occur in low - income countries in settings &#91; both hospital and community &#93; where there are no birth attendants or where birth attendants lack the necessary skills or equipment to prevent and manage PPH and shock . In hospital , obstetricians should try to perform the prediction and prevention of PPH , finding the risk factors for developing PPH and how can they be minimised .
The treatment of patients with PPH has two major components : &#91; 1 &#93; Resuscitation and management of obstetric hemorrhage and , possibly , hypovolemic shock and &#91; 2 &#93; Indentification and management of the underlying cause &#91; s &#93; of the hemorrhage . Successful management of PPH requires that both components be simultaneously and systematically addressed .
PPH is a potential life - threatening event . Right from the start , obstetricians have early opportunities to assess risk , anticipate , prevent , plan in advance of a PPH , and can help to improve patients outcomes

When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; Nothing To Envy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim Il-Sung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Korea , Japan are the enemies .
Although I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execution , but I thought my life in North Korea was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t eaten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so shocked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
Soon after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t erase from my memory .
A lifeless woman was lying on the ground , while an emaciated child in her arms just stared helplessly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s .
Ultimately , more than a million North Koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
Power outages also became more and more frequent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
This is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
As you can see , the river can be very narrow at certain points , allowing North Koreans to secretly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Korea , but I only can say that during the ugly years of the famine I was sent to China to live with distant relatives .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Korean refugee , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Korean refugees are considered in China as illegal migrants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be revealed , and I would be repatriated to a horrible fate back in North Korea .
One day , my worst nightmare came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
Someone had accused me of being North Korean , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
After they finished questioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
She &apos;s not North Korean . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
Some North Koreans in China seek asylum in foreign embassies , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and repatriated .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Every year , countless North Koreans are caught in China and repatriated to North Korea , where they can be tortured , imprisoned or publicly executed .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hiding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Korea , and I started a new life yet again .
Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
We are all Korean , but inside , we have become very different due to 67 years of division .
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
The North Korean authorities intercepted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a punishment , my family was going to be forcibly removed to a desolate location in the countryside .
They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea , so , ironically , I took a flight back to China and I headed toward the North Korean border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to guide them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Southeast Asia .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer .
He took everyone &apos;s I.D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
As the Chinese officer approached my family , I impulsively stood up , and I told him that these are deaf and dumb people that I was chaperoning .
He looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
We made it all the way to the border of Laos , but I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the border guards in Laos .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
After I paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of Laos .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Korean embassy .
I went back and forth between the immigration office and the police station , desperately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bribe or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without hesitating , the man went to the ATM and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Koreans to get out of jail .
I thanked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Korean people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
The kind stranger symbolized new hope for me and the North Korean people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Korean people need .
Eventually , after our long journey , my family and I were reunited in South Korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Many North Koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give aspiring North Koreans a chance to prosper with international support .
I &apos;m confident that you will see more and more North Koreans succeeding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
He &apos;s speechless , but he communicates joy in a way that some of the best orators cannot .
Remi knows what love is .
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
He &apos;s not greedy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .
When he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even I could remember , he reminds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Samuel is 16 . He &apos;s tall . He &apos;s very handsome .
He has the most impeccable memory .
He has a selective one , though .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he stole my chocolate bar , but he remembers the year of release for every song on my iPod , conversations we had when he was four , weeing on my arm on the first ever episode of Teletubbies , and Lady Gaga &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often bypassed and misunderstood .
But what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- autistic and extraordinary .
Now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
It manifests in each individual differently , hence why Remi is so different from Sam .
And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fastest-growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
And I cannot remember the first moment I encountered autism , but I cannot recall a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
And after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
He screamed a lot .
He didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me whatsoever .
Remi lived and reigned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the smallest things , like lining up cars around the room and staring at the washing machine and eating anything that came in between .
And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Yet beyond the tantrums and the frustration and the never-ending hyperactivity was something really unique : a pure and innocent nature , a boy who saw the world without prejudice , a human who had never lied .
Extraordinary .
Now , I cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wished that they were just like me .
But I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individuality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with normality .
Normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
It just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
And if I could communicate just one thing to Remi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because autistic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! Everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
The chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
It &apos;s made of asphalt , and asphalt is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s raining a lot .
Then you can have a lot of splash water in the asphalt .
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
Also , asphalt can create a lot of noise .
It &apos;s a noisy material , and if we produce roads like in the Netherlands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
The solution for that is to make roads out of porous asphalt .
Porous asphalt , a material that we use now in most of the highways in the Netherlands , it has pores and water can just rain through it , so all the rainwater will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no splash water anymore .
Also the noise will disappear in these pores .
Because it &apos;s very hollow , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
It also has disadvantages , of course , and the disadvantage of this road is that raveling can occur .
What is raveling ? You see that in this road that the stones at the surface come off .
First you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , I will not do that .
But they can damage your windshield , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
And finally , this raveling can also lead to more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create potholes with that .
Ha . He &apos;s ready .
Potholes , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
It &apos;s a porous asphalt , like I said , so you have only a small amount of binder between the stones .
Due to weathering , due to U.V. light , due to oxidation , this binder , this bitumen , the glue between the aggregates is going to shrink , and if it shrinks , it gets micro-cracks , and it delaminates from the aggregates .
Then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggregates -- what we just saw here .
To solve this problem , we thought of self-healing materials .
If we can make this material self-healing , then probably we have a solution .
So what we can do is use steel wool just to clean pans , and the steel wool we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the bitumen .
So then you have asphalt with very small pieces of steel wool in it .
Then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an induction machine .
Induction can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .
Then what you do is you heat up the steel , you melt the bitumen , and the bitumen will flow into these micro-cracks , and the stones are again fixed to the surface .
Today I use a microwave because I cannot take the big induction machine here onstage .
So a microwave is a similar system .
So I put the specimen in , which I &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
So this is the specimen coming out now .
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the specimens .
We tested a lot of specimens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very interesting . We have to try that . &quot;
So they donated to us a piece of highway , 400 meters of the A58 , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
So that &apos;s what we did here . You see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . That &apos;s what we know from practice .
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
So we did aging on the samples , did a lot of loading on it , healed them with our induction machine , and healed them and tested them again .
Several times we can repeat that .
So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our healing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course saves a lot of money .
Well , to conclude , I can say that we made a material using steel fibers , the addition of steel fibers , using induction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tricks .
And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
So we still have the specimen here . It &apos;s quite warm .
Actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the healing works .
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a disturbing question , which has an equally disturbing answer .
My topic is the secrets of domestic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tackle is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who beats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychiatrist , a social worker or an expert in domestic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just graduated from Harvard College .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and editor at Seventeen magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first little green American Express card , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that I had this gun loaded with hollow-point bullets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my soulmate , many , many times .
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threatened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psychological trap disguised as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical domestic violence survivor .
I have a B.A. in English from Harvard College , an MBA in marketing from Wharton Business School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for Fortune 500 companies including Johnson &amp; amp ; Johnson , Leo Burnett and The Washington Post .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Honda Odyssey minivan .
So my first message for you is that domestic violence happens to everyone -- all races , all religions , all income and education levels .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks domestic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of abusers are men , and domestic abuse happens only in intimate , interdependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason domestic abuse is so confusing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who beats me , but in fact I was a very typical victim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be domestic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abusive partners , boyfriends , and husbands in the United States .
I was also a very typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence , its warning signs or its patterns .
I met Conor on a cold , rainy January night .
He sat next to me on the New York City subway , and he started chatting me up .
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had just graduated from an Ivy League school , and that he worked at a very impressive Wall Street bank .
But what made the biggest impression on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
He had these big cheeks , these big apple cheeks and this wheat-blond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
One of the smartest things Conor did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship .
He did this especially at the beginning by idolizing me .
We started dating , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teenage girls , and my job .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my hopes and dreams .
Conor believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
And he also created a magical atmosphere of trust between us by confessing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been savagely and repeatedly physically abused by his stepfather , and the abuse had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in eighth grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years rebuilding his life .
Which is why that Ivy League degree and the Wall Street job and his bright shiny future meant so much to him .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who adored me would one day dictate whether or not I wore makeup , how short my skirts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laughed at you , because there was not a hint of violence or control or anger in Conor at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any domestic violence relationship is to seduce and charm the victim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to isolate the victim .
Now , Conor did not come home one day and announce , &quot; You know , hey , all this Romeo and Juliet stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I isolate you and I abuse you &quot; — — &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scream and out of this city where you have friends and family and coworkers who can see the bruises . &quot;
Instead , Conor came home one Friday evening and he told me that he had quit his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had quit his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abusive , dysfunctional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifices for your soulmate , so I agreed , and I quit my job , and Conor and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking headfirst into a carefully laid physical , financial and psychological trap .
The next step in the domestic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she reacts .
And here &apos;s where those guns come in .
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Connor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three guns .
He kept one in the glove compartment of our car .
He kept one under the pillows on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
And he said that he needed those guns because of the trauma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
But those guns were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in grave danger every minute of every day .
Conor first physically attacked me five days before our wedding .
It was 7 a.m. I still had on my nightgown .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a freelance writing assignment , and I got frustrated , and Conor used my anger as an excuse to put both of his hands around my neck and to squeeze so tightly that I could not breathe or scream , and he used the chokehold to hit my head repeatedly against the wall .
Five days later , the ten bruises on my neck had just faded , and I put on my mother &apos;s wedding dress , and I married him .
Despite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really stressed out by the wedding and by becoming a family with me .
It was an isolated incident , and he was never going to hurt me again .
It happened twice more on the honeymoon .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he punched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repeatedly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
And then a few days later , driving home from our honeymoon , he got frustrated by traffic , and he threw a cold Big Mac in my face .
Conor proceeded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mistaken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
One in three American women experiences domestic violence or stalking at some point in her life , and the CDC reports that 15 million children are abused every year , 15 million .
So actually , I was in very good company .
Back to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was abusing me .
Even though he held those loaded guns to my head , pushed me down stairs , threatened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ignition as I drove down the highway , poured coffee grinds on my head as I dressed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a battered wife .
Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply troubled man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Conor face his demons .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
To me , this is the saddest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an abuser .
Because the final step in the domestic violence pattern is kill her .
Over 70 percent of domestic violence murders happen after the victim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the abuser has nothing left to lose .
Other outcomes include long-term stalking , even after the abuser remarries ; denial of financial resources ; and manipulation of the family court system to terrify the victim and her children , who are regularly forced by family court judges to spend unsupervised time with the man who beat their mother .
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sadistic beating that broke through my denial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
We tend to stereotype victims as grisly headlines , self-destructive women , damaged goods .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
is code for some people for , &quot; It &apos;s her fault for staying , &quot; as if victims intentionally choose to fall in love with men intent upon destroying us .
But since publishing &quot; Crazy Love , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an invaluable life lesson from what happened , and who rebuilt lives -- joyous , happy lives -- as employees , wives and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical domestic violence victim and a typical domestic violence survivor .
I remarried a kind and gentle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that minivan .
What I will never have again , ever , is a loaded gun held to my head by someone who says that he loves me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being abused or who were abused as children or who are abusers themselves .
Abuse could be affecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final request of you .
Talk about what you heard here .
Abuse thrives only in silence .
You have the power to end domestic violence simply by shining a spotlight on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence .
Show abuse the light of day by talking about it with your children , your coworkers , your friends and family .
Recast survivors as wonderful , lovable people with full futures .
Recognize the early signs of violence and conscientiously intervene , deescalate it , show victims a safe way out .
Together we can make our beds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peaceful oases they should be .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
Vultures are amongst the most threatened group of birds .
When you see a vulture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are disgusting , ugly , greedy creatures that are just after your flesh , associated with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our sympathy . They really do .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlantic in 1832 on the Beagle , he saw the turkey vulture , and he said , &quot; These are disgusting birds with bald scarlet heads that are formed to revel in putridity . &quot;
You could not get a worse insult , and that from Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
They &apos;ve also be associated with Disney — — personified as goofy , dumb , stupid characters .
More recently , if you &apos;ve been following the Kenyan press — — these are the attributes that they associated the Kenyan MPs with . But I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
Because MPs do not keep the environment clean .
MPs do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
They are hardly monogamous .
They are far from being extinct .
And , my favorite is , vultures are better looking .
So there &apos;s two types of vultures in this planet .
There are the New World vultures that are mainly found in the Americas , like the condors and the caracaras , and then the Old World vultures , where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extinction .
So why are vultures important ? First of all , they provide vital ecological services . They clean up .
They &apos;re our natural garbage collectors .
They clean up carcasses right to the bone .
They help to kill all the bacteria . They help absorb anthrax that would otherwise spread and cause huge livestock losses and diseases in other animals .
Recent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vultures , carcasses take up to three to four times to decompose , and this has huge ramifications for the spread of diseases .
Vultures also have tremendous historical significance .
They have been associated in ancient Egyptian culture .
Nekhbet was the symbol of the protector and the motherhood , and together with the cobra , symbolized the unity between Upper and Lower Egypt .
In Hindu mythology , Jatayu was the vulture god , and he risked his life in order to save the goddess Sita from the 10-headed demon Ravana .
In Tibetan culture , they are performing very important sky burials . In places like Tibet , there are no places to bury the dead , or wood to cremate them , so these vultures provide a natural disposal system .
So what is the problem with vultures ?
We have eight species of vultures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threatened with extinction .
The reason is that they &apos;re getting poisoned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting poisoned is because there &apos;s human-wildlife conflicts . The pastoral communities are using this poison to target predators , and in return , the vultures are falling victim to this .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vultures are listed as critically endangered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling prey by consuming livestock that has been treated with a painkilling drug like Diclofenac .
This drug has now been banned for veterinary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
Because there are no vultures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of feral dogs at carcass dump sites , and when you have feral dogs , you have a huge time bomb of rabies . The number of cases of rabies has increased tremendously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa : 353 wind turbines are going to be up at Lake Turkana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind turbines do this to birds . They slice them in half .
They are bird-blending machines .
In West Africa , there &apos;s a horrific trade of dead vultures to serve the witchcraft and the fetish market .
So what &apos;s being done ? Well , we &apos;re conducting research on these birds . We &apos;re putting transmitters on them .
We &apos;re trying to determine their basic ecology , and see where they go .
We can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem locally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
We need to work with governments in regional levels .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about appreciating vultures , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
How can you help ? You can become active , make noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very misunderstood creatures . Volunteer your time to spread the word . Spread the word .
When you walk out of this room , you will be informed about vultures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about vultures .
They are very graceful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effortlessly without energy in the skies .
Kenya , this world , will be much poorer without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father shouted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total maverick from a remote province of Afghanistan , he insisted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was disowned by his father .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
During Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustrated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to quit , but my father , he would say , &quot; Listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fewer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so committed to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
He not only brags about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of Kabul .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
That &apos;s why I cofounded SOLA , the first and perhaps only boarding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still risky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
Like Ahmed . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ahmed is the father of one of my students .
Less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SOLA to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; Kill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ruin my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and backward ideas . &quot;
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. troops &apos; withdrawal .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , I see a promising future and lasting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SOLA remind me of that .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt .
And with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to SoundCloud and become famous .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
I &apos;m a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Berlin .
Let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change .
This is autumn 1989 , and imagine that all those people standing up and protesting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
Hold it up .
Hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
Hold it up . An Android , a Blackberry , wow .
That &apos;s a lot . Almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
And I will talk about this .
These are 35,830 lines of information .
Raw data .
And why are these informations there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.U. Commission tabled a directive .
This directive &#91; is &#93; called Data Retention Directive .
This directive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
Who calls whom ? Who sends whom an email ?
Who sends whom a text message ?
And if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
All this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provider .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want this data retention .
We want self-determination in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
They were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
And here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Berlin and said , &quot; Freedom , not fear . &quot;
And some even said , this would be Stasi 2.0 .
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany .
And I also ask myself , does it really work ?
Can they really store all this information about us ?
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
So I asked my phone company , Deutsche Telekom , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have stored about me .
And I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . It was only blah blah answers .
But then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are protocoling .
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .
So at the end , I had a settlement with them .
I &apos;ll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
Because in the mean time , the German Constitutional Court ruled that the implementation of this E.U. directive into German law was unconstitutional .
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside .
And on the C.D. , this was on .
Thirty-five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
At first I saw it , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a huge file . Okay .
But then after a while I realized , this is my life .
This is six months of my life , into this file .
So I was a little bit skeptical , what should I do with it ?
Because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean .
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did this .
This is a visualization of six months of my life .
You can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
You can see every step I take .
And you can even see how I go from Frankfurt by train to Cologne , and how often I call in between .
All this is possible with this information .
That &apos;s a little bit scary .
But it is not only about me .
It &apos;s about all of us .
First , it &apos;s only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
And then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
And after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
But you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
You can see all of this .
You can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran .
This is a blueprint how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
Like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Berlin in autumn of 1989 had a mobile phone in their pocket .
And the Stasi would have known who took part at this protest , and if the Stasi would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
And in the aftermath , also not the fall of the Iron Curtain .
Because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
They want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
But self-determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
But you have to fight for your self-determination today .
You have to fight for it every day .
So , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not outdated .
When you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it .
And if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
So , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self-determination in the digital age .
Thank you .
Photography has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most treasured photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
There were no art directors , no stylists , no chance for reshoots , not even any regard for lighting .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . We &apos;re on the corner of 57th and 5th .
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can see where this is going .
Approaching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take Sabina back to New York and make it a father-daughter trip , and continue the ritual ? &quot;
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
No one &apos;s ever refused , and luckily no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
Back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It &apos;s really become sacred to us .
This one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five-year-old could understand .
So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
They &apos;re also ways for us to freeze time for one week in October and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
Recently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stops dead in her tracks , and she points to a red awning of the doll store that she loved when she was little on our earlier trips .
And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five-year-old standing in that exact spot .
She said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
And now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colleges , because she &apos;s determined to go to school in New York .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but aside from these 15 shots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t hesitate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Thank you .
I have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile : &quot; Son , resist Gaddafi . Fight him .
But don &apos;t you ever turn into a Gaddafi-like revolutionary . &quot;
Almost two years have passed since the Libyan Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobilization in both the Tunisian and the Egyptian revolutions .
I joined forces with many other Libyans inside and outside Libya to call for a day of rage and to initiate a revolution against the tyrannical regime of Gaddafi .
And there it was , a great revolution .
Young Libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice .
They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
They have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
Eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
However , Gaddafi left behind a heavy burden , a legacy of tyranny , corruption and seeds of diversions .
For four decades Gaddafi &apos;s tyrannical regime destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Libyan society .
Aware of the devastation and the challenges , I was keen among many other women to rebuild the Libyan civil society , calling for an inclusive and just transition to democracy and national reconciliation .
Almost 200 organizations were established in Benghazi during and immediately after the fall of Gaddafi -- almost 300 in Tripoli .
After a period of 33 years in exile , I went back to Libya , and with unique enthusiasm , I started organizing workshops on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
With an amazing group of women , I co-founded the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lobby for the sociopolitical empowerment of women and to lobby for our right for equal participation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
I led an initiative by the Libyan Women &apos;s Platform for Peace to lobby for a more inclusive electoral law , a law that would give every citizen , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to stipulate on political parties the alternation of male and female candidates vertically and horizontally in their lists , creating the zipper list .
Eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
However , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out -- for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs .
On another day we wake up to the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack on the consulate .
On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the militias and their continuous violations of human rights of prisoners and their disrespect of the rule of law .
Our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles -- freedom , dignity , social justice -- that we first held .
Intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the &#91; aftermath &#93; of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
I &apos;m rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We did not prioritize right .
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
No , it didn &apos;t .
What is it , then ?
Why does our society continue to be polarized and dominated with selfish politics of dominance and exclusion , by both men and women ?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the feminine values of compassion , mercy and inclusion .
Our society needs national dialogue and consensus-building more than it needed the elections , which only reinforced polarization and division .
Our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
We need to develop a feminine discourse that not only honors but also implements mercy instead of revenge , collaboration instead of competition , inclusion instead of exclusion .
These are the ideals that a war-torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
For peace has an alchemy , and this alchemy is about the intertwining , the alternation between the feminine and masculine perspectives .
That &apos;s the real zipper .
And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
According to a Quranic verse &quot; Salam &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the all-merciful God , raheem . &quot;
In turn , the word &quot; raheem , &quot; which is known in all Abrahamic traditions , has the same root in Arabic as the word &quot; rahem &quot; -- womb -- symbolizing the maternal feminine encompassing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all peoples , have emanated from .
And so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo , which grows within it , the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence .
Thus we are told that &quot; My mercy encompasses all things . &quot;
Thus we are told that &quot; My mercy takes precedence over my anger . &quot;
May we all be granted a grace of mercy .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Alice in Wonderland .
Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
And I was scared .
Really scared . Scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
But as these conversations unfolded , I experienced what Alice must have when she went down that rabbit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was amazed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-scientists to have these interactions .
But these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonderland .
So scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us .
Don &apos;t just tell me that you study trabeculae , but tell me that you study trabeculae , which is the mesh-like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and treating osteoporosis .
And when you &apos;re describing your science , beware of jargon .
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
Sure , you can say &quot; spatial and temporal , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
Instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
A few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . Those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
And when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bullet points ?
What do bullets do ? Bullets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
A slide like this is not only boring , but it relies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhelmed .
Instead , this example slide by Genevieve Brown is much more effective . It &apos;s showing that the special structure of trabeculae are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the Eiffel Tower .
And the trick here is to use a single , readable sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visuals which appeal to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
And because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , I want to summarize with an equation .
Take your science , subtract your bullet points and your jargon , divide by relevance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multiply it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
Thank you .
Hi . My name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Actually , for 10 years .
And I feel like there &apos;s an uncomfortable tension in the room right now because I should not have worn this dress .
So luckily I brought an outfit change .
This is the first outfit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to witness it , I think .
If some of the women were really horrified when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief 10 seconds .
Not everybody gets to do that .
These heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
The worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
All right .
So why did I do that ?
That was awkward .
Well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
I was totally uncomfortable , and the photographer was telling me to arch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
And of course , barring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is superficial and immutable , has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
And I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
And I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
And I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was scouted , &quot; but that means nothing .
The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lottery , and I am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a legacy .
Well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and youth and symmetry that we &apos;re biologically programmed to admire , but also as tall , slender figures , and femininity and white skin .
And this is a legacy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a legacy that I &apos;ve been cashing out on .
And I know there are people in the audience who are skeptical at this point , and maybe there are some fashionistas who are , like , &quot; Wait . Naomi . Tyra . Joan Smalls . Liu Wen . &quot;
And first , I commend you on your model knowledge . Very impressive .
But unfortunately I have to inform you that in 2007 , a very inspired NYU Ph.D. student counted all the models on the runway , every single one that was hired , and of the 677 models that were hired , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-white .
The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
And the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
But the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
You know ? You can be anything .
You could be the President of the United States , or the inventor of the next Internet , or a ninja cardio-thoracic surgeon poet , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cameron , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my boss . &quot;
Because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the editor in chief of American Vogue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Steven Meisel .
Saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the Powerball when you grow up .
It &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accumulated model knowledge , because unlike cardio-thoracic surgeons , it can just be distilled right into -- right now .
So if the photographer is right there and the light is right there , like a nice HMI , and the client says , &quot; Cameron , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quarters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imaginary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
It will look something like this .
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
That was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a résumé and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your résumé reads , &quot; Underwear Model : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they retouch all the photos ? &quot;
And yeah , they pretty much retouch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had worn a bikini , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
Here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
My friend got to come with me .
Here &apos;s me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue .
Here &apos;s me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .
And here &apos;s me today .
And I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
They are constructions , and they are constructions by a group of professionals , by hairstylists and makeup artists and photographers and stylists and all of their assistants and pre-production and post-production , and they build this . That &apos;s not me .
Okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
I do have too many 8-inch heels which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
When I was a teenager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; Sorry , officer , &quot; and we were on our way .
And I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 140,000 teenagers that were stopped and frisked , 86 percent of them were black and Latino , and most of them were young men .
And there are only 177,000 young black and Latino men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot;
When I was researching this talk , I found out that of the 13-year-old girls in the United States , 53 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 78 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
So the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
And I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit skinnier and you have shinier hair , you will be so happy and fabulous . &quot;
And when we &apos;re backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
And those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am insecure . &quot;
And I &apos;m insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
And if you ever are wondering , &quot; If I have thinner thighs and shinier hair , will I be happier ? &quot;
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thinnest thighs and the shiniest hair and the coolest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically insecure women probably on the planet .
So when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , &quot; and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
But mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when I am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
But I &apos;m also happy and honored to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more agency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
If there &apos;s a takeaway to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
Thank you .
There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
So over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
And these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
How can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
And how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I am in love with New Orleans .
My soul is always soothed by the giant live oak trees , shading lovers , drunks and dreamers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone sneezes , New Orleans has a parade .
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a nicer space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
Her name was Joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the day-to-day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this abandoned house into a giant chalkboard and stenciled it with a fill-in-the-blank sentence : &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of chalk , reflect on their lives , and share their personal aspirations in public space .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
And I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to straddle the International Date Line . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to sing for millions . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live off the grid . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be someone &apos;s cavalry . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
So this neglected space became a constructive one , and people &apos;s hopes and dreams made me laugh out loud , tear up , and they consoled me during my own tough times .
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
It &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
It &apos;s about making space for reflection and contemplation , and remembering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and I made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Kazakhstan , South Africa , Australia , Argentina and beyond .
Together , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
In our age of increasing distractions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
Death is something that we &apos;re often discouraged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
Thinking about death clarifies your life .
Our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , well , I do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
No one knows what the hell we do .
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
So , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on .
Now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Now , sadly , neurological disorders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradually destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend Jan Stripling , who was a virtuoso ballet dancer in his time .
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
However , there are 6.3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
We need to be able to measure progression objectively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an objective measure that can answer that for sure .
But frustratingly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement disorders , there are no biomarkers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20-minute neurologist test .
You have to go to the clinic to do it . It &apos;s very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . It &apos;s never done .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
Now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
No expensive staff time required .
Takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist &apos;s clinic to do it .
So what I want to propose to you as an unconventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtuosos like my friend Jan Stripling .
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
Now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vocal ballet dancers , because we have to coordinate all of these vocal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . FoxP2 , for example .
And like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
From the sound , we can actually track the vocal fold position as it vibrates , and just as the limbs are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vocal organs .
So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
The speech actually becomes quieter and more breathy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
So these vocal effects can actually be quite subtle , in some cases , but with any digital microphone , and using precision voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quantify exactly where somebody lies on a continuum between health and disease using voice signals alone .
So these voice-based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? We &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-invasive .
The neurologist &apos;s test is non-invasive . They both use existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
And they &apos;re both accurate . Okay , but in addition , voice-based tests are non-expert .
That means they can be self-administered .
They &apos;re high-speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
They &apos;re ultra-low cost , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes ultra-low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
We can do high-frequency monitoring to get objective data .
We can perform low-cost mass recruitment for clinical trials , and we can make population-scale screening feasible for the first time .
We have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
So , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re launching the Parkinson &apos;s Voice Initiative .
With Aculab and PatientsLikeMe , we &apos;re aiming to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tackle these four goals .
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Anyone healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Thank you .
So Max , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
What are you going to get out of those samples ?
Yeah . Yeah . So what will happen is that , during the call you have to indicate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . Right .
You see , some people may not do it . They may not get through it .
But we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
So you &apos;re 86 percent accurate right now ?
It &apos;s much better than that .
Actually , my student Thanasis , I have to plug him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has proved that it works over the mobile telephone network as well , which enables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accuracy .
Ninety-nine . Well , that &apos;s an improvement .
So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Absolutely .
Thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
Thanks , Tom .
I live in South Central .
This is South Central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
So the city planners , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
This is South Los Angeles .
Liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
Just like 26.5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Central Los Angeles , home of the drive-thru and the drive-by .
Funny thing is , the drive-thrus are killing more people than the drive-bys .
People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles .
For instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , Beverly Hills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
And I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks .
And I figured , this has to stop .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
Food is the problem and food is the solution .
Plus I got tired of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn &apos;t impregnated with pesticides .
So what I did , I planted a food forest in front of my house .
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
Thing is , it &apos;s owned by the city .
But you have to maintain it .
So I &apos;m like , &quot; Cool . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I gotta maintain it . &quot;
And this is how I decided to maintain it .
So me and my group , L.A. Green Grounds , we got together and we started planting my food forest , fruit trees , you know , the whole nine , vegetables .
What we do , we &apos;re a pay-it-forward kind of group , where it &apos;s composed of gardeners from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunteer , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody complained .
The city came down on me , and basically gave me a citation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this citation was turning into a warrant .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Cool . Bring it . &quot;
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
So L.A. Times got ahold of it . Steve Lopez did a story on it and talked to the councilman , and one of the Green Grounds members , they put up a petition on Change.org , and with 900 signatures , we were a success .
We had a victory on our hands .
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
That &apos;s 20 Central Parks .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
Why in the hell would they not okay this ?
Growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When one dollar &apos;s worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
It &apos;s my gospel , when I &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
Growing your own food is like printing your own money .
See , I have a legacy in South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refuse to be a part of this manufactured reality that was manufactured for me by some other people , and I &apos;m manufacturing my own reality .
See , I &apos;m an artist .
Gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art .
Just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , I beautiful lawns , parkways .
I use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cloth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my embellishment for that cloth .
You &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
You just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
So what happened ?
I have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
We are the soil .
You &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
Plus you get strawberries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so ashamed .
So I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
This is on the street for a reason .
It made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; Fin , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to steal your food ? &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Hell no , I ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re gonna steal it .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . &quot;
There &apos;s another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles .
These are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
It was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
We &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our dig-ins and participate , and it &apos;s all volunteers .
If kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
But when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food affects the mind and the body , they blindly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- I see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
So with gardening , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
We might produce the next George Washington Carver .
but if we don &apos;t change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
Now this is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
The funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
What I &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pride and the honor in growing your own food , opening farmer &apos;s markets .
So what I want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades , gangstas , gangsta gardeners .
We gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
If you ain &apos;t a gardener , you ain &apos;t gangsta .
Get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
And let that be your weapon of choice .
So basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit -- where you talk about doing some shit .
If you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Nairobi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s cows at the back , and behind the cows , that &apos;s the Nairobi National Park .
Nairobi National Park is not fenced in the south widely , which means wild animals like zebras migrate out of the park freely .
So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our livestock .
This is one of the cows which was killed at night , and I just woke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
My community , the Maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
The morans are the warriors who protect our community and the livestock , and they &apos;re also upset about this problem .
So they kill the lions .
It &apos;s one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s cows , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the cowshed .
But lions are very clever .
They will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
So he jumps in and kills the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the cowshed with a torch , and that day , the lions didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electronics .
So I got an old car battery , an indicator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a motorcycle , and it helps motorists when they want to turn right or left . It blinks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small torch from a broken flashlight .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar panel charges the battery , and the battery supplies the power to the small indicator box . I call it a transformer .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that &apos;s where the lions come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to lions when they come at night .
The lights flash and trick the lions into thinking I was walking around the cowshed , but I was sleeping in my bed .
Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it &apos;s also being used to scare elephants away from people &apos;s farms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a scholarship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Brookhouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re installing the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father &apos;s cows , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
So you got this scholarship . Yep .
You &apos;re working on other electrical inventions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . Electric fence ?
But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
You already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .
In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
We &apos;re going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much . Thank you .
Everything I do , and everything I do professionally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
From 1971 to 1977 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not — -- I worked in Zambia , Kenya , Ivory Coast , Algeria , Somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Italian NGO , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was distraught .
I thought , age 21 , that we Italians were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ripples from the Zambezi , &quot; was a project where we Italians decided to teach Zambian people how to grow food .
So we arrived there with Italian seeds in southern Zambia in this absolutely magnificent valley going down to the Zambezi River , and we taught the local people how to grow Italian tomatoes and zucchini and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
And we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
We had these magnificent tomatoes . In Italy , a tomato would grow to this size . In Zambia , to this size .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Zambians , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
When the tomatoes were nice and ripe and red , overnight , some 200 hippos came out from the river and they ate everything .
And we said to the Zambians , &quot; My God , the hippos ! &quot;
And the Zambians said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Italians blundering around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Zambia .
Because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
You should see the rubbish — -- You should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting African people .
You want to read the book , read &quot; Dead Aid , &quot; by Dambisa Moyo , Zambian woman economist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
We Western people are imperialist , colonialist missionaries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either patronize them , or we are paternalistic .
The two words come from the Latin root &quot; pater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
But they mean two different things .
Paternalistic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; I love you so much . &quot;
Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; bwana , &quot; boss .
I was given a slap in the face reading a book , &quot; Small is Beautiful , &quot; written by Schumacher , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentleman who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not neocolonial ? &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called Enterprise Facilitation , where you never initiate anything , you never motivate anybody , but you become a servant of the local passion , the servant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
So what you do -- you shut up .
You never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We don &apos;t work from offices .
We meet at the cafe . We meet at the pub .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arriving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
Entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
So planning has this blind spot .
The smartest people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
What we do , we work one-on-one , and to work one-on-one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new profession .
The profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tryout in Esperance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph.D. at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
And so what I did in Esperance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first client , and I helped this first guy who was smoking fish from a garage , was a Maori guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Perth , to get organized , and then the fishermen came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Maori ? Can you help us ? &quot;
And I helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in Albany for 60 cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to Japan for 15 dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; How can you do that ?
How can you do — ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
So — — So the government says , &quot; Do it again . &quot;
We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
Peter Drucker , one of the greatest management consultants in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter Drucker was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter Drucker says : &quot; Planning is actually incompatible with an entrepreneurial society and economy . &quot;
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
So now you &apos;re rebuilding Christchurch without knowing what the smartest people in Christchurch want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to offer them confidentiality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in droves .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
Local , passionate people . That &apos;s who you have applauded .
So what I &apos;m saying is that entrepreneurship is where it &apos;s at .
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- nonrenewable fossil fuels , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Universities ? Forget about it !
Government ? Forget about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
There &apos;s a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of New York in 1860 .
And in 1860 , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was unanimous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
They were already drowning in manure .
So 1860 , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of New York .
So what happens ? In 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,001 car manufacturing companies -- 1,001 .
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little factories in backwaters .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confidentiality .
Otherwise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
The smallest company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beautifully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
Guess what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 iconic companies of the world -- Carnegie , Westinghouse , Edison , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Yahoo .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : None were started by one person .
Now we teach entrepreneurship to 16-year-olds in Northumberland , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography , and the task of the 16-year-olds is to underline , in the first two pages of Richard Branson &apos;s autobiography how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
Never the word &quot; I , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have facilitators who come from a small business background sitting in cafes , in bars , and your dedicated buddies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentleman who talks about this epic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; Would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
We activate communities .
We have groups of volunteers supporting the Enterprise Facilitator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the miracle of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by capturing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
Thank you .
Before March , 2011 , I was a photographic retoucher based in New York City .
We &apos;re pale , gray creatures .
We hide in dark , windowless rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
We make skinny models skinnier , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get criticized in the press all the time , but some of us are actually talented artists with years of experience and a real appreciation for images and photography .
On March 11 , 2011 , I watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tragic events unfolded in Japan .
Soon after , an organization I volunteer with , All Hands Volunteers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers , knew we couldn &apos;t just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May the 13th , I made my way to the town of Ōfunato .
It &apos;s a small fishing town in Iwate Prefecture , about 50,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
The waters here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles inland .
As you can imagine , the town had been devastated .
We pulled debris from canals and ditches .
We cleaned schools . We de-mudded and gutted homes ready for renovation and rehabilitation .
We cleared tons and tons of stinking , rotting fish carcasses from the local fish processing plant .
We got dirty , and we loved it .
For weeks , all the volunteers and locals alike had been finding similar things .
They &apos;d been finding photos and photo albums and cameras and SD cards .
And everyone was doing the same .
They were collecting them up , and handing them in to various places around the different towns for safekeeping .
Now , it wasn &apos;t until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
As they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
At the end of my first week there , I found myself helping out in an evacuation center in the town .
I was helping clean the onsen , the communal onsen , the huge giant bathtubs .
This happened to also be a place in the town where the evacuation center was collecting the photos .
This is where people were handing them in , and I was honored that day that they actually trusted me to help them start hand-cleaning them .
Now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and I &apos;ve always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn &apos;t until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
As I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the envelope from the processing lab , I couldn &apos;t help but think as a retoucher that I could fix that tear and mend that scratch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
So that evening , I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhelming and so positive , I knew we had to give it a go .
So we started retouching photos .
This was the very first .
Not terribly damaged , but where the water had caused that discoloration on the girl &apos;s face had to be repaired with such accuracy and delicacy .
Otherwise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that &apos;s as tragic as having the photo damaged .
Over time , more photos came in , thankfully , and more retouchers were needed , and so I reached out again on Facebook and LinkedIn , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Within two weeks , I had 150 people wanting to join in .
Within Japan , by July , we &apos;d branched out to the neighboring town of Rikuzentakata , further north to a town called Yamada .
Once a week , we would set up our scanning equipment in the temporary photo libraries that had been set up , where people were reclaiming their photos .
The older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scanner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scanned , uploaded to a cloud server , it would be downloaded by a gaijin , a stranger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
The time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it depended obviously on the damage involved .
It could take an hour . It could take weeks .
It could take months .
The kimono in this shot pretty much had to be hand-drawn , or pieced together , picking out the remaining parts of color and detail that the water hadn &apos;t damaged .
It was very time-consuming .
Now , all these photos had been damaged by water , submerged in salt water , covered in bacteria , in sewage , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand-cleaning them was a huge part of the project .
We couldn &apos;t retouch the photo unless it was cleaned , dry and reclaimed .
Now , we were lucky with our hand-cleaning .
We had an amazing local woman who guided us .
It &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those damaged photos .
As my team leader Wynne once said , it &apos;s like doing a tattoo on someone .
You don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
She had started hand-cleaning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
She also had duplicates .
Areas like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and remake the whole photo .
When she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
Her photos were found by her husband &apos;s colleagues at a local fire department in the debris a long way from where the home had once stood , and they &apos;d recognized him .
The day of the tsunami , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the tsunami gates were closed .
He had to go towards the water as the sirens sounded .
Her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
One of them got caught up in the water .
It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survived .
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her youngest son &apos;s 14th birthday .
For her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he remembered from before that wasn &apos;t still scarred from that day in March when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1,100 volunteers had passed through All Hands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand-clean over 135,000 photographs , the large majority a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully restored and retouched .
During this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was printer inks .
We take photos constantly .
A photo is a reminder of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They &apos;re our memory-keepers and our histories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
That &apos;s all this project was about , about restoring those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person receiving it .
The project &apos;s also made a big difference in the lives of the retouchers .
For some of them , it &apos;s given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their talents on something other than skinny models and perfect skin .
I would like to conclude by reading an email I got from one of them , Cindy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
&quot; As I worked , I couldn &apos;t help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images .
One in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gathered around a baby , struck a chord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and newborn daughter , hangs on our wall .
Across the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
Thank you .
I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine shaft in Ghana .
The air is thick with heat and dust , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the brush of sweaty bodies passing me in the darkness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the shaft is this cacophony of men coughing , and stone being broken with primitive tools .
Like the others , I wear a flickering , cheap flashlight tied to my head with this elastic , tattered band , and I can barely make out the slick tree limbs holding up the walls of the three-foot square hole dropping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand slips , I suddenly remember a miner I had met days before who had lost his grip and fell countless feet down that shaft .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , risking their lives without payment or compensation , and often dying .
I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re trapped in slavery .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been documenting indigenous cultures in more than 70 countries on six continents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the sole exhibitor at the Vancouver Peace Summit .
Amongst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a supporter of Free the Slaves , an NGO dedicated to eradicating modern day slavery .
We started talking about slavery , and really , I started learning about slavery , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honestly ashamed at my own lack of knowledge of this atrocity in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started burning a hole in my stomach , so within weeks , I flew down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of Free the Slaves and offer them my help .
Thus began my journey into modern day slavery .
Oddly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the skeletons hidden in the closet .
A conservative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people enslaved in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans-Atlantic slave trade .
A hundred and fifty years ago , an agricultural slave cost about three times the annual salary of an American worker .
That equates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be enslaved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
Astonishingly , slavery generates profits of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tricked by false promises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s slavery is about commerce , so the goods that enslaved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disposable .
Slavery exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
In India and Nepal , I was introduced to the brick kilns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dante &apos;s Inferno .
Enveloped in temperatures of 130 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were cloaked in a heavy blanket of dust , while mechanically stacking bricks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the scorching kilns to trucks hundreds of yards away .
Deadened by monotony and exhaustion , they work silently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no breaks for food , no water breaks , and the severe dehydration made urinating pretty much inconsequential .
So pervasive was the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to even touch and ceased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cruiser to clean out my gear and run it under an air conditioner to revive it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
Back in the kilns , I wanted to cry , but the abolitionist next to me quickly grabbed me and he said , &quot; Lisa , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional displays are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citizen of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on Free the Slaves to work within the system for their liberation , and I trusted that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my heartbreak .
In the Himalayas , I found children carrying stone for miles down mountainous terrain to trucks waiting at roads below .
The big sheets of slate were heavier than the children carrying them , and the kids hoisted them from their heads using these handmade harnesses of sticks and rope and torn cloth .
It &apos;s difficult to witness something so overwhelming .
How can we affect something so insidious , yet so pervasive ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re enslaved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these villagers claimed their freedom , the slaveholders burned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so petrified , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center rallied for them to persevere , and abolitionists on the ground helped them get a quarry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back-breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Sex trafficking is what we often think of when we hear the word slavery , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was warned that it would be difficult for me to work safely within this particular industry .
In Kathmandu , I was escorted by women who had previously been sex slaves themselves .
They ushered me down a narrow set of stairs that led to this dirty , dimly fluorescent lit basement .
This wasn &apos;t a brothel , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
Cabin restaurants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venues for forced prostitution .
Each has small , private rooms , where the slaves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to entertain the clients , encouraging them to buy more food and alcohol .
Each cubicle is dark and dingy , identified with a painted number on the wall , and partitioned by plywood and a curtain .
The workers here often endure tragic sexual abuse at the hands of their customers .
Standing in the near darkness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that instant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be trapped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the stairs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
These people have no escape at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that slavery , including sex trafficking , occurs in our own backyard as well .
Tens of hundreds of people are enslaved in agriculture , in restaurants , in domestic servitude , and the list can go on .
Recently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 American children are sold into sex slavery every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The textile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about slave labor .
I visited villages in India where entire families were enslaved in the silk trade .
This is a family portrait .
The dyed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mix dye in these big barrels , and they submerge the silk into the liquid up to their elbows , but the dye is toxic .
My interpreter told me their stories .
&quot; We have no freedom , &quot; they said .
&quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house someday and go someplace else where we actually get paid for our dyeing . &quot;
It &apos;s estimated that more than 4,000 children are enslaved on Lake Volta , the largest man-made lake in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
Wrong . They were all enslaved .
Children are taken from their families and trafficked and vanished , and they &apos;re forced to work endless hours on these boats on the lake , even though they do not know how to swim .
This young child is eight years old .
He was trembling when our boat approached , frightened it would run over his tiny canoe .
He was petrified he would be knocked in the water .
The skeletal tree limbs submerged in Lake Volta often catch the fishing nets , and weary , frightened children are thrown into the water to untether the lines .
Many of them drown .
For as long as he can recall , he &apos;s been forced to work on the lake .
Terrified of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cruelty all his life , he passes that down to the younger slaves that he manages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were hauling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a.m.
in the cold , windy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these nets weigh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to Kofi .
Kofi was rescued from a fishing village .
I met him at a shelter where Free the Slaves rehabilitates victims of slavery .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a bath at the well , pouring big buckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , Kofi has been reunited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
Kofi is the embodiment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
Driving down a road in Ghana with partners of Free the Slaves , a fellow abolitionist on a moped suddenly sped up to our cruiser and tapped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dirt road into the jungle .
At the end of the road , he urged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
Then he pointed toward this barely visible footpath , and said , &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot;
As we started down the path , we pushed aside the vines blocking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the trail had become flooded by recent rains , so I hoisted the photo gear above my head as we descended into these waters up to my chest .
After another two hours of hiking , the winding trail abruptly ended at a clearing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a football field , and all of them were full of enslaved people laboring .
Many women had children strapped to their backs while they were panning for gold , wading in water poisoned by mercury .
Mercury is used in the extraction process .
These miners are enslaved in a mine shaft in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the shaft , they were soaking wet from their own sweat .
I remember looking into their tired , bloodshot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
The shafts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy bags of stone that later will be transported to another area , where the stone will be pounded so that they can extract the gold .
At first glance , the pounding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fringes , and children too .
All of them are victim to injury , illness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this muscular person will end up like this one here , racked with tuberculosis and mercury poisoning in just a few years .
This is Manuru . When his father died , his uncle trafficked him to work with him in the mines .
When his uncle died , Manuru inherited his uncle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being enslaved in the mines .
When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amputated .
On top of that , Manuru has tuberculosis , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine shaft .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educated with the help of local activists like Free the Slaves , and it &apos;s this sort of determination , in the face of unimaginable odds , that fills me with complete awe .
I want to shine a light on slavery .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of candles with me , and with the help of my interpreter , I imparted to the people I was photographing that I wanted to illuminate their stories and their plight , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be bearing witness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deserving of the same rights , dignity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mistreated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images awaken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ignite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on slavery , for without that light , the beast of bondage can continue to live in the shadows .
Thank you very much .
Stanton Rogers was destined to be President of the United States . He was a charismatic politician , highly visible to an approving public , and backed by powerful friends . Unfortunately for Rogers , his libido got in the way of his career . Or , as the Washington mavens put it : &quot; Old Stanton fucked himself out of the presidency . &quot;
It was not that Stanton Rogers fancied himself a Casanova . On the contrary , until that one fatal bedroom escapade , he had been a model husband . He was handsome , wealthy , and on his way to one of the most important positions in the world , and although he had had ample opportunity to cheat on his wife , he had never given another woman a thought .
Whereas Barbara , the woman Rogers fell in love with and eventually married after a much - headlined divorce , was five years older than Stanton , pleasant - faced rather than pretty , and seemed to have nothing in common with him . Stanton was athletic ; Barbara hated all forms of exercise . Stanton was gregarious ; Barbara preferred to be alone with her husband or to entertain small groups . The biggest surprise to those who knew Stanton Rogers was the political differences . Stanton was a liberal , while Barbara had grown up in a family of archconservatives .
You and Liz are practically in the Guinness Book of World Records as the perfect married couple . You can &apos;t throw that away for some quick lay . &quot;
&quot; Do you have any idea what this is going to do to your career
&quot; Half the marriages in this country end in divorce . It won &apos;t do anything , &quot; Stanton Rogers had replied .
He had proved to be a poor prophet . News of the bitterly fought divorce was manna for the press , and the gossip papers played it up as luridly as possible , with pictures of Stanton Rogers &apos;s love nest and stories of secret midnight trysts . The newspapers kept the story alive as long as they could , and when the furor died down , the powerful friends who had backed Stanton Rogers for the presidency quietly disappeared . They found a new white knight to champion : Paul Ellison .
Ellison was a sound choice . While he had neither Stanton Rogers &apos;s good looks nor his charisma , he was intelligent , likable , and had the right background . He was short in stature , with regular , even features and candid blue eyes . He had been happily married for ten years to the daughter of a steel magnate , and he and Alice were known as a warm and loving couple .
Like Stanton Rogers , Paul Ellison had attended Yale and was graduated from Harvard Law School . The two men had grown up together . Their families had had adjoining summer homes at Southampton , and the boys swam together , organized baseball teams , and later , double - dated . They were in the same class at Harvard . Paul Ellison did well , but it was Stanton Rogers who was the star pupil . Stanton Rogers &apos;s father was a senior partner in a prestigious Wall Street law firm , and when Stanton worked there summers , he arranged for Paul to be there . Once out of law school , Stanton Rogers &apos;s political star began rising meteorically , and if he was the comet , Paul Ellison was the tail .
The divorce changed everything . It was now Stanton Rogers who became the appendage to Paul Ellison . The trail leading to the top of the mountain took almost fifteen years . Ellison lost an election for Senate , won the following one , and in the next few years became a highly popular , articulate lawmaker . He fought against waste in government and Washington bureaucracy . He was a populist , and believed in international detente . He was asked to give the nominating speech for the incumbent President running for reelection . It was a brilliant , impassioned speech that made everyone sit up and take notice . Four years later , Paul Ellison was elected President of the United States . His first appointment was Stanton Rogers as presidential foreign affairs adviser .
Marshall McLuhan &apos;s theory that television would turn the world into a global village had become a reality . The inauguration of the forty - second President of the United States was carried by satellite to more than 190 countries .
In the Black Rooster , a Washington , D.C. , hangout for newsmen , Ben Cohn , a veteran political reporter for The Washington Post , was seated at a table with four colleagues , watching the inauguration on the large television set over the bar .
&quot; The son of a bitch cost me fifty bucks , &quot; one of the reporters complained .
&quot; I warned you not to bet against Ellison , &quot; Ben Cohn chided . &quot; He &apos;s got the magic , baby . You &apos;d better believe it . &quot;
The camera panned to show the massive crowds gathered on Pennsylvania Avenue , huddled inside their overcoats against the bitter January wind , listening to the ceremony on loudspeakers set up around the podium . Jason Merlin , Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court , finished the swearing - in oath , and the new President shook his hand and stepped up to the microphone .
&quot; Look at those idiots standing out there freezing their asses off , &quot; Ben Cohn commented . &quot; Do you know why they aren &apos;t home like normal human beings , watching it on television
&quot; Because a man is making history , my friends . One day all those people are going to tell their children and grandchildren that they were there the day Paul Ellison was sworn in . And they &apos;re all going to brag , &apos;I was so close to him I could have touched him . &apos; &quot;
&quot; And proud of it . Every politician in the world comes out of the same cookie cutter . They &apos;re all in it for what they can get out of it . Face it , fellas , our new President is a liberal and an idealist . That &apos;s enough to give any intelligent man nightmares . My definition of a liberal is a man who has his ass firmly stuck in clouds of cotton wool . &quot;
The truth was that Ben Cohn was not as cynical as he sounded . He had covered Paul Ellison &apos;s career from the beginning , and while it was true that he had not been impressed at first , as Ellison moved up the political ladder Ben Cohn began to change his opinion . This politician was nobody &apos;s yes - man . He was an oak in a forest of willows .
Outside , the sky exploded into icy sheets of rain . Ben Cohn hoped the weather was not an omen of the four years that lay ahead . He turned his attention back to the television set .
&quot; The presidency of the United States is a torch lit by the American people and passed from hand to hand every four years . The torch that has been entrusted to my care is the most powerful weapon in the world . It is powerful enough to burn down civilization as we know it , or to be a beacon that will light the future for us and for the rest of the world . It is our choice to make . I speak today not only to our allies , but to those countries in the Soviet camp . I say to them now , as we prepare to move into the twenty - first century , that there is no longer any room for confrontation and that we must learn to make the phrase one world become a reality . Any other course can only create a holocaust from which no nation would ever recover . I am well aware of the vast chasms that lie between us and the iron curtain countries , but the first priority of this administration will be to build unshakable bridges across those chasms . &quot;
His words rang out with a deep , heartfelt sincerity . He means it , Ben Cohn thought . I hope no one assassinates the bastard .
In Junction City , Kansas , it was a potbellied stove kind of day , bleak and raw , and snowing so hard that the visibility on Highway 6 was almost zero . Mary Ashley cautiously steered her old station wagon toward the center of the highway , where the snowplows had been at work . The storm was going to make her late for the class she was teaching . She drove slowly , careful not to let the car go into a skid .
From the car radio came the President &apos;s voice : &quot; …are many in government as well as in private life who insist that America build more moats instead of bridges . My answer to that is that we can no longer afford to condemn ourselves or our children to a future threatened by global confrontations , and nuclear war . &quot;
Mary Ashley thought : I &apos;m glad I voted for him . Paul Ellison is going to make a great President .
Her grip tightened on the wheel as the snow became a blinding white whirlwind .
&quot; Leave it alone . I wanna hear what he has to say . &quot;
&quot; As you are aware , three years ago , upon the death of Romania &apos;s President , Nicolae Ceau§escu , Romania broke off diplomatic relations with the United States . I want to inform you now that we have approached the government of Romania and its President , Alexandras Ionescu , and he has agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations with our country . &quot;
There was a cheer from the crowd on Pennsylvania Avenue .
Lantz did not hear her . His eyes were glued to the television set .
&quot; One of our first official acts , &quot; the President was saying , &quot; will be to send an ambassador to Romania . And that is merely the beginning… &quot;
In Bucharest , it was evening . The winter weather had turned unexpectedly mild and the streets of the late marketplaces were crowded with citizens lined up to shop in the unseasonably warm weather .
Romanian President Alexandras Ionescu sat in his office in Peles , the old palace , on Calea Victoriei , surrounded by half a dozen aides , listening to the broadcast on a shortwave radio .
&quot; …I have no intention of stopping there , &quot; the American President was saying . &quot; Albania broke off all diplomatic relations with the United States in 1946 . I intend to reestablish those ties . In addition , I intend to strengthen our diplomatic relations with Bulgaria , with Czechoslovakia , and with East Germany . &quot;
Over the radio came the sounds of cheers and applause .
&quot; Sending our ambassador to Romania is the beginning of a worldwide people - to - people movement . Let us never forget that all mankind shares a common origin , common problems , and a common ultimate fate . Let us remember that the problems we share are greater than the problems that divide us , and that what divides us is of our own making . &quot;
In a heavily guarded villa in Neuilly , a suburb of Paris , the Romanian revolutionary leader , Marin Groza , was watching the President on Chaine 2 Television .
&quot; …I promise you now that I will do my best , and that I will seek out the best in others . &quot;
The applause lasted fully five minutes .
Marin Groza said , thoughtfully , &quot; I think our time has come , Lev . He really means it . &quot;
Lev Pasternak , his security chief , replied , &quot; Won &apos;t this help Ionescu
Marin Groza shook his head . &quot; Ionescu is a tyrant , so in the end , nothing will help him . But I must be very careful with my timing . I failed when I tried to overthrow Ceau§escu . I must not fail again . &quot;
Pete Connors was not drunk &#93; not as drunk as he intended to get . He had finished almost a fifth of Scotch , when Nancy , the secretary he lived with , said , &quot; Don &apos;t you think you &apos;ve had enough , Pete
&quot; Our President &apos;s talkin &apos; . You gotta show some respect . &quot; He turned to look at the image on the television set . &quot; You communist son of a bitch , &quot; he yelled at the screen . &quot; This is my country , and the CIA &apos;s not gonna let you give it away . We &apos;re gonna stop you , Charlie . You can bet your ass on it . &quot;
Paul Ellison said , &quot; I &apos;m going to need a lot of help from you , old friend . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ll get it , &quot; Stanton Rogers replied quietly .
It was their first meeting together in this office , and President Ellison was uncomfortable .
If Stanton hadn &apos;t made that one mistake , Paul Ellison thought , he would be sitting at this desk instead of me .
As though reading his mind , Stanton Rogers said , &quot; I have a confession to make . The day you were nominated for the presidency , I was as jealous as hell , Paul . It was my dream , and you were living it . But do you know something
I finally came to realize that if I couldn &apos;t sit in that chair , there was no one else in the world I would want to sit there but you . That chair suits you . &quot;
Paul Ellison smiled at his friend and said , &quot; To tell you the truth , Stan , this room scares the hell out of me . I feel the ghosts of Washington and Lincoln and Jefferson . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ve also had Presidents who &#93; &quot;
&quot; I know . But it &apos;s the great ones we have to try to live up to . &quot;
He pressed the button on his desk , and seconds later a white - jacketed steward came into the room .
&quot; No , thanks . Barbara wants me to watch my waistline . &quot;
The President nodded to Henry , the steward , and he quietly left the room .
Barbara . She had surprised everyone . The gossip around Washington was that the marriage would not last out the first year . But it had been almost fifteen years now , and it was a success . Stanton Rogers had built up a prestigious law practice in Washington , and Barbara had earned the reputation of being a gracious hostess .
&quot; My people - to - people speech seems to have caused quite an uproar . I suppose you &apos;ve seen all the newspapers . &quot;
Stanton Rogers shrugged . &quot; You know how they are . They love to build up heroes so they can knock them down . &quot;
&quot; Quite candidly , you &apos;re scaring the hell out of a lot of people , Paul . The armed forces are against your plan , and some powerful movers and shakers would like to see it fail . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not going to fail . &quot; He leaned back in his chair . &quot; Do you know the biggest problem with the world today
There are no more statesmen . Countries are being run by politicians . There was a time not too long ago when this earth was peopled with giants . Some were good , and some were evil &#93; but , by God , they were giants . Roosevelt and Churchill , Hitler and Mussolini , Charles de Gaulle and Joseph Stalin . Why did they all live at that one particular time
Why aren &apos;t there any statesmen today
&quot; It &apos;s pretty hard to be a world giant on a twenty - one - inch screen . &quot;
The steward appeared , bearing a silver tray with a pot of coffee and two cups , each imprinted with the presidential seal . He skillfully poured the coffee . &quot;
&quot; I want to talk to you about finding the right ambassador to Romania . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have to tell you how important this is . I want you to move on it as quickly as possible . &quot;
In the little suburb of Neuilly , it was two A.M. Marin Groza &apos;s villa lay in ebon darkness , the moon nested in a thick layer of storm clouds . The streets were hushed at this hour , with only the sound of an occasional passerby rippling the silence . A black - clad figure moved noiselessly through the trees toward the brick wall that surrounded the villa . Over one shoulder he carried a rope and a blanket , and in his arms was cradled an Uzi with a silencer and a dart gun . When he reached the wall , he stopped and listened . He waited , motionless , for five minutes . Finally , satisfied , he uncoiled the nylon rope and tossed the scaling hook attached to the end of it upward until it caught on the far edge of the wall . Swiftly , the man began to climb . When he reached the top of the wall , he flung the blanket across it to protect himself against the poison - tipped metal spikes embedded on top . He stopped again to listen . He reversed the hook , shifting the rope to the inside of the wall , and slid down onto the grounds . He checked the balisong at his waist , the deadly Filipino folding knife that could be flicked open or closed with one hand .
The attack dogs would be next . The intruder crouched there , waiting for them to pick up his scent . There were three Dobermans , trained to kill . But they were only the first obstacle . The grounds and the villa were filled with electronic devices , and continuously monitored by television cameras . All mail and packages were received at the gatehouse and opened there by the guards . The doors of the villa were bombproof . The villa had its own water supply , and Marin Groza had a food taster . The villa was impregnable . Supposedly .
He heard the sounds of the dogs rushing at him before he saw them . They came flying out of the darkness , charging at his throat . There were two of them . He aimed the dart gun and shot the nearest one on his left first , and then the one on his right , dodging out of the way of their hurtling bodies . He spun around , alert for the third dog , and when it came , he fired again , and then there was only stillness .
The intruder knew where the sonic traps were buried in the ground , and he skirted them . He silently glided through the areas of the grounds that the television cameras did not cover , and in less than two minutes after he had gone over the wall , he was at the back door of the villa .
As he reached for the handle of the door , he was caught in the sudden glare of floodlights . A voice called out , &quot; Freeze
The figure in black carefully dropped his gun and looked up . There were half a dozen men spread out on the roof , with a variety of weapons pointed at him .
&quot; What the fuck took you so long
I never should have gotten this far . &quot;
&quot; You didn &apos;t , &quot; the head guard informed him . &quot; We started tracking you before you got over the wall . &quot;
Lev Pasternak was not mollified . &quot; Then you should have stopped me sooner . I could have been on a suicide mission with a load of grenades or a goddamn mortar . I want a meeting of the entire staff tomorrow morning , eight o &apos;clock sharp . The dogs have been stunned . Have someone keep an eye on them until they wake up . &quot;
Lev Pasternak prided himself on being the best security guard in the world . He had been a pilot in the Israeli Six - Day War , and after the war had become a top agent in Mossad , one of Israel &apos;s five secret services .
He would never forget the morning , two years earlier , when his colonel had called him into his office .
&quot; Lev , someone wants to borrow you for a few weeks . &quot;
&quot; I hope it &apos;s a blonde , &quot; Lev quipped .
Mossad had a complete file on the Romanian dissident . Groza had been the leader of a popular Romanian movement to depose Alexandros Ionescu and was about to stage a coup when he was betrayed by one of his men . More than two dozen underground fighters had been executed , and Groza had barely escaped the country with his life . France had given him sanctuary . Ionescu denounced Marin Groza as a traitor to his country and put a price on his head . So far half a dozen attempts to assassinate Groza had failed , but he had been wounded in the latest attack .
&quot; He needs someone to set up a foolproof security system . He came to us . I recommended you . &quot;
&quot; Our information is that he has enough popular support in his home country to knock over Ionescu . When the timing is right , he &apos;ll make his move . Meanwhile , we have to keep the man alive . &quot;
The colonel had been wrong about the time , but he had been right about Marin Groza . He was a thin , fragile - looking man with an ascetic air about him and a face etched with sorrow . He had an aquiline nose , a firm chin , and a broad forehead , topped by a spray of white hair . He had deep black eyes , and when he spoke , they blazed with passion .
&quot; I don &apos;t give a damn whether I live or die , &quot; he told Lev at their first meeting . &quot; We &apos;re all going to die . It &apos;s the when that I &apos;m concerned about . I have to stay alive for another year or two . That &apos;s all the time I need to drive Ionescu out of my country .
Lev Pasternak went to work on the security system at the villa in Neuilly . He used some of his own men , and the outsiders he hired were checked out thoroughly . Every single piece of equipment was state of the art .
When Marin Groza asked Pasternak to stay on as his security chief , Pasternak did not hesitate .
&quot; I &apos;ll do it , &quot; he said , &quot; until you &apos;re ready to make your move . Then I will return to Israel . &quot;
At irregular intervals , Pasternak staged surprise attacks on the villa , testing its security . Now , he thought : Some of the guards are getting careless . I &apos;ll have to replace them .
As he reached Marin Groza &apos;s bedroom , he heard a loud crash , and a moment later Groza began screaming out in agony .
Headquarters for the Central Intelligence Agency is located across the Potomac River in Langley , Virginia , seven miles northwest of Washington , D.C. At the approach road to the agency is a flashing red beacon on top of a gate . The gatehouse is guarded twenty - four hours a day , and authorized visitors are issued colored badges giving them access only to the particular department with which they have business . Outside the gray seven - level headquarters building , whimsically called the Toy Factory , is a large statue of Nathan Hale . Inside , on the ground floor , a glass corridor wall faces an inner courtyard with a landscaped garden dotted with magnolia trees .
The public is never admitted inside the building , and there are no facilities for visitors . For those who wish to enter the compound &quot; black &quot; &#93; unseen &#93; there is a tunnel that emerges onto a foyer facing a mahogany elevator door , watched around the clock by a squad of gray - flanneled sentries .
In the seventh - floor conference room , guarded by security aides armed with snub - nosed thirty - eight revolvers under their business suits , the Monday morning executive staff meeting was under way . Seated around the large oak table were Ned Tillingast , director of the CIA ; General Oliver Brooks , Army Chief of Staff ; Secretary of State Floyd Baker ; Pete Connors , chief of counterintelligence ; and Stanton Rogers .
Ned Tillingast , the CIA director , was in his sixties , a cold , taciturn man , burdened with maleficent secrets . There is a light branch and a dark branch of the CIA. The dark branch handles clandestine operations , and for the past seven years , Tillingast had been in charge of the forty - five hundred employees working in that section .
General Oliver Brooks was a West Point soldier who conducted his personal and professional life by the book . He was a company man , and the company he worked for was the United States Army .
Floyd Baker , the secretary of state , was an anachronism , a throwback to an earlier era . He was of Southern vintage , tall , silver - haired , and distinguished - looking , with an old - fashioned gallantry . He was a man who wore mental spats . He owned a chain of influential newspapers around the country , and was reputed to be enormously wealthy .
Pete Connors was black - Irish , a stubborn bulldog of a man , hard - drinking and fearless . This was his last year with the CIA. He faced compulsory retirement in June . Connors was chief of the counterintelligence staff , the most secret , highly compartmentalized branch of the CIA. He had worked his way up through the various intelligence divisions , and had been around in the good old days when CIA agents were the golden boys . Pete Connors had been a golden boy himself . He had taken part in the coup that restored the Shah to the Peacock Throne in Iran , and had been involved in Operation Mongoose , the attempt to topple Castro &apos;s government in 1961 .
&quot; After the Bay of Pigs , everything changed , &quot; Pete would mourn from time to time . The length of his diatribe usually depended upon how drunk he was . &quot; The bleeding hearts attacked us on the front pages of every newspaper in the world . They called us a bunch of lying , sneaking clowns who couldn &apos;t get out of our own way . Some anti - CIA bastard published the names of our agents , and Dick Welch , our chief of station in Athens , was murdered . &quot;
Pete Connors had gone through three miserable marriages because of the pressures and secrecy of his work , but as far as he was concerned , no sacrifice was too great to make for his country . Now , in the middle of the meeting , his face was red with anger .
&quot; If we let the President get away with his fucking people - to - people program , he &apos;s going to give the country away . It has to be stopped . We can &apos;t allow &#93; &quot;
&quot; The President has been in office less than a week . We &apos;re all here to carry out his policies and &#93; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not here to hand over my country to the damned Commies , mister . The President never even mentioned his plan before his speech . He sprang it on all of us . We didn &apos;t have a chance to get together a rebuttal . &quot;
&quot; Connors has a point . The President is actually planning to invite Romania , Albania , Bulgaria , and the other Communist countries to send their spies here posing as cultural attaches and chauffeurs and secretaries and maids . We &apos;re spending billions of dollars to guard the back door , and the President wants to throw open the front door . &quot;
&quot; I wasn &apos;t consulted , either . In my opinion , the President &apos;s plan could damn well destroy this country . &quot;
&quot; Gentlemen , some of us may disagree with the President , but let &apos;s not forget that the people voted for Paul Ellison to run this country . &quot; His eyes flicked across the men seated around him . &quot; We &apos;re all part of the President &apos;s team , and we have to follow his lead and support him in every way we can .
&quot; Everything . Give it to me straight . What &apos;s the situation in Romania with Alexandras Ionescu
&quot; Ionescu &apos;s riding high in the saddle , &quot; Ned Tillingast replied . &quot; Once he got rid of the Ceau§escu family , all of Ceau§escu &apos;s allies were assassinated , jailed , or exiled . Since he seized power , Ionescu &apos;s been bleeding the country dry . The people hate his guts . &quot;
&quot; What about the prospects for a revolution
&quot; Ah . That &apos;s rather interesting . Remember a couple of years back when Marin Groza almost toppled the Ionescu government
&quot; Yes . Groza got out of the country by the skin of his butt . &quot;
&quot; With our help . Our information is that there &apos;s a popular ground swell to bring him back . Groza would be good for Romania , and if he got in , it would be good for us . We &apos;re keeping a close watch on the situation . &quot;
&quot; Do you have that list of candidates for the Romanian post
&quot; These are our top prospects . They &apos;re all qualified career diplomats . Each one of them has been cleared . No security problems , no financial problems , no embarrassing skeletons in the closet . &quot;
As Stanton Rogers took the list , the secretary of state added
&quot; I agree . &quot; Stanton Rogers rose to his feet . &quot; I &apos;ll discuss these names with the President and get back to you . He &apos;s anxious to fill the appointment as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; But I &apos;m right , &quot; Pete Connors said stubbornly . &quot; The President is trying to sell out the country . What are we supposed to do
&quot; Ned , we &apos;re trained to find the enemy and kill him . What if the enemy is behind our lines &#93; sitting in the Oval Office
Tillingast had been around longer than Pete Connors . He had been a member of Wild Bill Donovan &apos;s OSS before it became the CIA. He too hated what the bleeding hearts in Congress were doing to the organization he loved .
Ned Tillingast had recruited Pete Connors out of college , and Connors had turned out to be one of the best . But in the last few years , Connors had become a cowboy &#93; a little too independent , a little too quick on the trigger . Dangerous .
&quot; Pete &#93; have you heard anything about an underground organization calling itself Patriots for Freedom
&quot; No . Can &apos;t say that I have . Who are they
&quot; So far they &apos;re just a rumor . All I have is smoke . See if you can get a lead on them . &quot;
An hour later , Pete Connors was making a phone call from a public booth at Hains Point .
Riding back to the office in his limousine , Stanton Rogers opened the envelope containing the names of the candidates for the ambassadorship and studied them . It was an excellent list . The secretary of state had done his homework . The candidates had all served in Eastern and Western European countries , and a few of them had additional experience in the Far East or Africa . The President &apos;s going to be pleased , Stanton thought .
&quot; They &apos;re dinosaurs , &quot; Paul Ellison snapped . He threw the list down on his desk . &quot; Every one of them . &quot;
&quot; Paul , &quot; Stanton protested , &quot; these people are all experienced career diplomats . &quot;
Our experienced career diplomat in Bucharest screwed up and we were out in the cold . The pinstriped boys worry me . They &apos;re all out to cover their asses . When I talked about a people - to - people program , I meant every word of it . We need to make a positive impression on a country that at this moment is very wary of us . &quot;
&quot; But if you put an amateur in there &#93; someone with no experience &#93; you &apos;re taking a big risk . &quot;
He hesitated . &quot; I &apos;m not kidding myself . My credibility is on the line . I know that there are a lot of powerful people who don &apos;t want to see this work . If it fails , I &apos;m going to get cut off at the knees . I &apos;ll have to forget about Bulgaria , Albania , Czechoslovakia , and the rest of the iron curtain countries . And I don &apos;t intend for that to happen . &quot;
&quot; I can check out some of our political appointees who &#93; &quot;
&quot; Same problem . I want someone with a completely fresh point of view . Someone who can thaw the ice . The opposite of the ugly American . &quot;
&quot; Paul &#93; I get the impression that you already have someone in mind . Do you
&quot; As a matter of fact , &quot; he said slowly , &quot; I think I may have . &quot;
&quot; She . Did you happen to see the article in the current issue of Foreign Affairs magazine called &apos;Detente Now &apos;
&quot; I thought it was interesting . The author believes that we &apos;re in a position to try to seduce the Communist countries into coming into our camp by offering them economic and &#93; &quot; He broke off . &quot; It was a lot like your inaugural speech . &quot;
&quot; Only it was written six months earlier . She &apos;s published brilliant articles in Commentary and Public Affairs . Last year I read a book of hers on Eastern European politics , and I must admit , it helped clarify some of my ideas . &quot;
&quot; All right . So she agrees with your theories . That &apos;s no reason to consider her for a post as imp &#93; &quot;
&quot; Stan &#93; she went further than my theory . She outlined a detailed plan that &apos;s brilliant . She wants to take the four major world economic pacts and combine them . &quot;
&quot; It would take time , but it could be done . Look . You know that in 1949 the Eastern - bloc countries formed a pact for mutual economic assistance , called COMECON , and in 1958 the other European countries formed the EEC &#93; the Common Market . &quot;
&quot; We have the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , which includes the United States , some Western - bloc countries , and Yugoslavia . And don &apos;t forget that the Third World countries have formed a nonaligned movement that excludes us . &quot; The President &apos;s voice was charged with excitement . &quot; Think of the possibilities . If we could combine all these plans and form one big marketplace &#93; my God , it could be awesome
It would mean real world trade . And it could bring peace . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s an interesting idea , but it &apos;s a long way off . &quot;
&quot; You know the old Chinese saying , &apos;A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step . &apos; &quot;
&quot; Some of our finest ambassadors have been amateurs . Anne Armstrong , the former ambassador to Great Britain , was an educator with no political experience . Perle Mesta was appointed to Luxembourg , Clare Boothe Luce was ambassador to Italy . John Gavin , an actor , was the ambassador to Mexico . One third of our current ambassadors are what you call amateurs . &quot;
&quot; But you don &apos;t know anything about this woman . &quot;
&quot; Except that she &apos;s damned bright and that we &apos;re on the same wavelength . I want you to find out everything you can about her . &quot;
Two days later , President Ellison and Stanton Rogers breakfasted together .
Stanton Rogers pulled a paper from his pocket . &quot; Mary Elizabeth Ashley , Twenty - seven Old Milford Road , Junction City , Kansas . Age , almost thirty - five , married to Dr . Edward Ashley &#93; two children , Beth twelve and Tim ten . Chairwoman of the Junction City Chapter of the League of Women Voters . Assistant Professor , East European political science , Kansas State University . Grandfather born in Romania .
&quot; I think so too . I &apos;d like to have a full security check run on her . &quot;
&quot; I disagree , Professor Ashley . &quot; Barry Dylan , the brightest and youngest of the students in Mary Ashley &apos;s political science seminar , looked around defiantly . &quot; Alexandras Ionescu is worse than Ceau§escu ever was . &quot;
&quot; Can you give us some facts to back up that statement
She was a superb teacher , with an easy sense of humor and a warmth that made being around her a pleasure . She had an oval face that changed from interesting to beautiful , depending on her mood . She had the high cheekbones of a model and almond - shaped hazel eyes . Her hair was dark and thick . She had a figure that made her female students envious , and the males fantasize , yet she was unaware of how beautiful she was .
Barry was wondering if she was happy with her husband . He reluctantly brought his attention back to the problem at hand .
&quot; Well , when Ionescu took over Romania , he cracked down on all the pro - Groza elements and reestablished a hard - line , pro - Soviet position . Even Ceau§escu wasn &apos;t that bad . &quot;
Another student spoke up . &quot; Then why is President Ellison so anxious to establish diplomatic relations with him
&quot; Because we want to woo him into the Western orbit . &quot;
&quot; What about Romania &apos;s current relationship with the other Warsaw Pact countries , and Russia in particular
Another voice . &quot; I don &apos;t agree . Romania criticized Russia &apos;s invasion of Afghanistan , and they criticized the Russians &apos; arrangement with the EEC. Also , Professor Ashley &#93; &quot;
&quot; Monday we &apos;ll talk about the basic factors that affect the Soviet attitude toward Eastern Europe , and we &apos;ll discuss the possible consequences of President Ellison &apos;s plan to penetrate the Eastern bloc . Have a good weekend . &quot;
Mary watched the students rise and head for the door .
Mary Ashley loved the give - and - take of the seminar . History and geography came alive in the heated discussions among the bright young graduate students . Foreign names and places became real , and historical events took on flesh and blood . This was her fifth year on the faculty of Kansas State University , and teaching still excited her . She taught five political science classes a year in addition to the graduate seminars , and each of them dealt with the Soviet Union and its satellite countries . At times she felt like a fraud . I &apos;ve never been to any of the countries I teach about , she thought . I &apos;ve never even been outside the United States .
Mary had planned a trip abroad when she received her master &apos;s degree , but that summer she met Edward Ashley , and the European trip turned into a three - day honeymoon at Waterville , fifty - five miles from Junction City , where Edward was taking care of a critical heart patient .
&quot; We really must travel next year , &quot; Mary said to Edward shortly after they were married . &quot; I &apos;m dying to see Rome and Paris and Romania . &quot;
&quot; So am I. It &apos;s a date . Next summer . &quot;
Two years later , Tim was born . Mary had gotten her Ph . D. and gone back to teaching at Kansas State University , and somehow the years had melted away . Except for brief trips to Chicago , Atlanta , and Denver , Mary had never been out of the state of Kansas .
One day , she promised herself . One day…
Frost had painted the window a winter gray , and it was beginning to snow again . She put on her lined leather coat and a red woolen scarf and headed toward the Vattier Street entrance , where she had parked her car .
The campus was huge , 315 acres dotted with eighty - seven buildings , including laboratories , theaters , and chapels , amid a rustic setting of trees and grass . From a distance , the brown limestone buildings of the university , with their turrets , re sembled ancient castles ready to repel enemy hordes .
One hour later , the photograph was on its way to Washington , D.C.
Every town has its own distinctive rhythm , a life pulse that springs from the people and the land . Junction City , in Geary County , is a farm community , population 20 , 381 , 130 miles west of Kansas City , priding itself on being the geographical center of the continental United States . It has a newspaper &#93; The Daily Union &#93; a radio station , and a television station . The downtown shopping area consists of a series of scattered stores and gas stations along Sixth Street and on Washington . There is a J. C. Penney &apos;s , the First National Bank , a Domino Pizza , Flower Jeweler &apos;s , and a Woolworth &apos;s . There are fast - food chains , a bus station , a menswear shop , and a liquor store &#93; the type of establishments that are duplicated in hundreds of small towns across the United States . But the residents of Junction City love it for its bucolic peace and tranquillity . On weekdays , at least . Weekends , Junction City becomes the rest - and - recreation center for the soldiers at nearby Fort Riley .
Mary Ashley stopped to shop for dinner at Dillon &apos;s Market on her way home and then headed north toward Old Milford Road , a lovely residential area overlooking a lake . Oak and elm trees lined the left side of the road , while on the right side were beautiful houses variously made of stone , brick , or wood .
The Ashleys lived in a two - story stone house set in the middle of gently rolling hills . It had been bought by Dr . Edward Ashley and his bride thirteen years earlier . It consisted of a large living room , dining room , library , breakfast room , and kitchen downstairs , and a master suite and two additional bedrooms upstairs .
&quot; It &apos;s awfully large for just two people , &quot; Mary Ashley had protested .
When Mary arrived home from the university , Tim and Beth were waiting to greet her .
&quot; Tim said . &quot; We &apos;re going to have our pictures in the paper
&quot; Help me put away the groceries , &quot; Mary said . &quot; What paper
&quot; The man didn &apos;t say , but he took our pictures and he said we &apos;d hear from him . &quot;
Mary stopped and turned to look at her son .
&quot; No , &quot; Tim said , &quot; but he sure had a nifty Nikon . &quot;
On Sunday , Mary celebrated &#93; although that was not the word that sprang to her mind &#93; her thirty - fifth birthday . Edward had arranged a surprise party for her at the country club . Their neighbors , Florence and Douglas Schiffer , and four other couples were waiting for her . Edward was as delighted as a small child at the look of amazement on Mary &apos;s face when she walked into the club and saw the festive table and the happy birthday banner . She did not have the heart to tell him that she had known about the party for the past two weeks . She adored Edward . And why not
He was attractive and intelligent and caring . His grandfather and father had been doctors , and it had never occurred to Edward to be anything else . He was the best surgeon in Junction City , a good father , and a wonderful husband .
As Mary blew out the candles on her birthday cake , she looked across at Edward and thought : How lucky can a lady be ?
Monday morning , Mary awoke with a hangover . There had been a lot of champagne toasts the night before , and she was not used to drinking alcohol . It took an effort to get out of bed .
She eased her way downstairs and gingerly set about preparing breakfast for the children , trying to ignore the pounding in her head .
&quot; Champagne , &quot; Mary groaned , &quot; is France &apos;s vengeance against us . &quot;
Beth walked into the room carrying an armful of books .
&quot; When you &apos;re right , you &apos;re right . &quot; Mary put a box of cereal on the table . &quot; I bought a new cereal for you . You &apos;re going to like it . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t eat this . You &apos;re trying to kill me . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t put any ideas in my head , &quot; her mother cautioned . &quot; Would you please eat your breakfast
Tim , her ten - year - old , ran into the kitchen . He slid into a chair at the table and said
&quot; I &apos;m glad you mentioned that . Mrs. Reynolds called me . You &apos;re failing math . What do you say to that
&quot; Tim , is that supposed to be a joke
&quot; I personally don &apos;t think it &apos;s funny , &quot; Beth sniffed .
&quot; That &apos;s enough , &quot; Mary said . &quot; Behave yourselves . &quot;
Her headache was getting worse .
&quot; Can I go to the skating rink after school , Mom
&quot; You &apos;re already skating on thin ice . You &apos;re to come right home and study . How do you think it looks for a college professor to have a son who &apos;s failing math
Mary thought grimly . What about the terrible nines , tens , elevens , and twelves ?
&quot; Did Tim tell you he got a D in spelling
&quot; Haven &apos;t you ever heard of Mark Twain
&quot; What does Mark Twain have to do with this
&quot; Mark Twain said he has no respect for a man who can only spell a word one way . &quot;
We can &apos;t win , Mary thought . They &apos;re smarter than we are .
She had packed a lunch for each of them , but she was concerned about Beth , who was on some kind of crazy new diet .
&quot; Please , Beth , eat all of your lunch today . &quot;
&quot; If it has no artificial preservatives . I &apos;m not going to let the greed of the food industry ruin my health . &quot;
Whatever happened to the good old days of junk food
Tim plucked a loose paper from one of Beth &apos;s notebooks .
It &apos;s signed &apos;Virgil . &apos; I thought you were in love with Arnold . &quot;
The pounding in Mary &apos;s head was becoming unbearable .
She heard the horn of the school bus outside . Tim and Beth started toward the door .
She followed them out into the hallway .
&quot; It &apos;s freezing outside . Put on your coats and scarves . &quot;
And they were gone . Mary felt drained .
Even after all these years , Mary thought , he &apos;s still the most attractive man I &apos;ve ever known .
&quot; Morning , darling . &quot; He gave her a kiss . They walked into the kitchen .
&quot; Sweetheart &#93; would you do me a favor
&quot; Sure , beautiful . Anything . &quot;
&quot; I want to sell the children . &quot;
&quot; Strangers . They &apos;ve reached the age where I can &apos;t do anything right . Beth has become a health - food freak , and your son is turning into a world - class dunce . &quot;
&quot; Maybe they &apos;re not our kids . &quot;
&quot; I hope not . I &apos;m making oatmeal for you . &quot;
&quot; Sorry , darling . No time . I &apos;m due in surgery in half an hour . Hank Cates got tangled up in some machinery . He may lose a few fingers . &quot;
&quot; Isn &apos;t he too old to still be farming
&quot; Don &apos;t let him hear you say that . &quot;
Mary knew that Hank Cates had not paid her husband &apos;s bills in three years . Like most of the farmers in the community , he was suffering from the low farm prices and the Farm Credit Administration &apos;s indifferent attitude toward them . Many were losing farms they had worked on all their lives . Edward never pressed any of his patients for money , and many of them paid him with crops . The Ashleys had a cellar full of corn , potatoes , and wheat . One farmer had offered to give Edward a cow in payment , but when Edward told Mary about it , she said
Mary looked at her husband now and thought again : How lucky I am .
&quot; Okay , &quot; she said . &quot; I may decide to keep the kids . I like their father a lot . &quot;
&quot; He took her in his arms and held her close . &quot; Happy birthday , plus one . &quot;
&quot; Do you still love me now that I &apos;m an older woman
&quot; Mary suddenly remembered something . &quot; I &apos;ve got to get home early today and prepare dinner . It &apos;s our turn to have the Schiffers over . &quot;
Bridge with their neighbors was a Monday night ritual . The fact that Douglas Schiffer was a doctor and worked with Edward at the hospital made them even closer .
Mary and Edward left the house together , bowing their heads against the relentless wind . Edward strapped himself into his Ford Granada and watched Mary as she got behind the wheel of the station wagon .
&quot; The highway is probably icy , &quot; Edward called . &quot; Drive carefully . &quot;
She blew him a kiss , and the two cars drove away from the house , Edward heading toward the hospital , and Mary driving toward the town of Manhattan , where the university was located , sixteen miles away .
Two men in an automobile parked half a block from the Ashley house watched the cars leave . They waited until the vehicles were out of sight .
They drove up to the house next door to the Ashleys . Rex Olds , the driver , sat in the car while his companion walked up to the front door and rang the bell .
&quot; My name is Donald Zamlock . I &apos;m with the Security Agency of the State Department . &quot;
Don &apos;t tell me Doug has robbed a bank
&quot; No , ma &apos;am . Not that we know of . I wanted to ask you a few questions about your neighbor , Mrs. Ashley . &quot;
She looked at him with sudden concern .
Florence Schiffer led him into the living room .
&quot; No , thanks . I &apos;ll only take a few minutes of your time . &quot;
&quot; Why would you be asking about Mary
&quot; This is just a routine check . She &apos;s not suspected of any wrongdoing . &quot;
Florence Schiffer said indignantly . &quot; Mary Ashley is one of the nicest persons you &apos;ll ever meet . &quot; She added , &quot; Have you met her
&quot; No , ma &apos;am . This visit is confidential , and I would appreciate it if you kept it that way . How long have you known Mrs. Ashley
&quot; About thirteen years . Since the day she moved in next door . &quot;
&quot; Would you say that you know Mrs. Ashley well
&quot; Of course I would . Mary &apos;s my closest friend . What &#93;
&quot; Do she and her husband get along well
&quot; Next to Douglas and me , they &apos;re the happiest couple I &apos;ve ever known . &quot; She thought a moment . &quot; I take that back . They are the happiest couple I &apos;ve ever known . &quot;
&quot; I understand Mrs. Ashley has two children . A girl twelve and a boy ten
&quot; That &apos;s right . Beth and Tim . &quot;
&quot; Would you say she &apos;s a good mother
&quot; She &apos;s a great mother . What &apos;s &#93;
&quot; Mrs. Schiffer , in your opinion , is Mrs. Ashley an emotionally stable person
&quot; She has no emotional problems that you are aware of
&quot; No . She doesn &apos;t like alcohol . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve come to the wrong town , mister . We don &apos;t have a drug problem in Junction City . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ashley is married to a doctor
&quot; You &apos;re way off base . She doesn &apos;t do drugs . She doesn &apos;t snort , and she doesn &apos;t shoot up . &quot;
&quot; You seem to know all the terminology . &quot;
&quot; I watch Miami Vice , like everybody else . &quot; Florence Schiffer was getting angry . &quot; Do you have any more questions
&quot; Mary Ashley &apos;s grandfather was born in Romania . Have you ever heard her discuss Romania
&quot; Oh , once in a while she &apos;ll tell stories her grandfather told her about the old country . Her grandfather was born in Romania but he came over here when he was in his teens . &quot;
&quot; Have you ever heard Mrs. Ashley express a negative opinion about the present Romanian government
&quot; No . Not that I can remember . &quot;
&quot; One last question . Have you ever heard Mrs. Ashley or Dr . Ashley say anything against the United States government
They went by the chamber of commerce and the Royal Order of the Elks building , Irma &apos;s Pet Grooming and a bar called The Fat Chance . The commercial buildings came to an abrupt end .
&quot; Jesus , the main street is only two blocks long . This isn &apos;t a town . It &apos;s a pit stop . &quot;
Rex Olds said , &quot; To you it &apos;s a pit stop , and to me it &apos;s a pit stop , but to these people it &apos;s a town . &quot;
Zamlock shook his head . &quot; It &apos;s probably a nice place to live , but I sure as hell wouldn &apos;t want to visit here . &quot;
The sedan pulled up in front of the state bank and Rex Olds went inside .
&quot; Clean , &quot; he said , getting into the car . &quot; The Ashleys have seven thousand dollars in the bank , a mortgage on their house , and they pay their bills on time . The president of the bank thinks the doctor is too soft - hearted to be a good businessman , but as far as he &apos;s concerned , he &apos;s a top credit risk . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s check out a few more names and get back to civilization before I begin to moo . &quot;
Douglas Schiffer was normally a pleasant , easygoing man , but at the moment there was a grim expression on his face . The Schiffers and the Ashleys were in the middle of their weekly bridge game , and the Schiffers were ten thousand points behind . For the fourth time that evening , Florence Schiffer had reneged .
&quot; he exploded . &quot; Which side are you playing on
Do you know how much we &apos;re down
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , &quot; she said nervously . &quot; I &#93; I just can &apos;t seem to concentrate . &quot;
&quot; Obviously , &quot; her husband snorted .
&quot; Is anything bothering you
&quot; Edward Ashley asked Florence .
&quot; I can &apos;t tell you . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re in some sort of trouble , aren &apos;t you
No . I &#93; what makes you think that
&quot; I &apos;m not supposed to tell . I promised . &quot;
&quot; A federal agent from Washington . He was at the house this morning asking me all kinds of questions about Mary . He made her sound like some kind of international spy . &quot;
&quot; What kind of questions
&quot; Oh , you know . Was she a loyal American
Was she a good wife and mother
Was she on drugs
&quot; Why the devil would they be asking you questions like that
&quot; Wait a minute , &quot; Mary said excitedly . &quot; I think I know . It &apos;s about my tenure . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m up for tenure . The university does some sensitive government research on campus , so I suppose they have to check everyone pretty thoroughly . &quot;
&quot; Florence Schiffer breathed a sigh of relief . &quot; I thought they were going to lock you up . &quot;
&quot; I hope they do , &quot; Mary smiled . &quot; At Kansas State . &quot;
&quot; Douglas Schiffer said , &quot; can we get on with the game
&quot; He turned to his wife . &quot; If you renege one more time , I &apos;m going to put you over my knee . &quot;
&quot; We are meeting under the usual rules , &quot; the chairman announced . &quot; No records will be kept , this meeting will never be discussed , and we will refer to one another by the code names we have been assigned . &quot;
There were eight men inside the library of the fifteenth - century Claymore Castle . Two armed men in plain clothes , bundled up in heavy overcoats , kept vigil outside , while a third man guarded the door to the library . The eight men inside the room had arrived at the site separately a short time earlier .
This time he could very well be successful . &quot;
&quot; How would that affect our plan
&quot; It could destroy it . It would open too many bridges to the West . &quot;
Freyr said , &quot; Then we must prevent it from happening . &quot;
&quot; We assassinate Groza , &quot; the chairman replied .
His villa seems to be impregnable . Anyway , no one in this room can afford to be involved in an assassination attempt . &quot;
&quot; We wouldn &apos;t be directly involved , &quot; the chairman said .
&quot; The Controller discovered a confidential dossier that concerns an international terrorist who &apos;s for hire . &quot;
&quot; Abul Abbas , the man who organized the hijacking of the Achille Lauro
&quot; No . There &apos;s a new gun in town , gentlemen . A better one . He &apos;s called Angel . &quot;
&quot; Never heard of him , &quot; Sigmund said .
&quot; Exactly . His credentials are most impressive . According to the Controller &apos;s file , Angel was involved in the Sikh Khalistan assassination in India . He helped the Macheteros terrorists in Puerto Rico , and the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia . He &apos;s masterminded the assassinations of half a dozen army officers in Israel and the Israelis have offered a million - dollar reward for him , dead or alive . &quot;
&quot; He sounds promising , &quot; Thor said . &quot; Can we get him
&quot; He &apos;s expensive . If he agrees to take the contract , it will cost us two million dollars . &quot;
Freyr whistled , then shrugged . &quot; That can be handled . We &apos;ll take it from the general fund we &apos;ve set up . &quot;
&quot; How do we get to this Angel person
&quot; All his contacts are handled through his mistress , a woman named Neusa Muñez . &quot;
&quot; She lives in Argentina . Angel has set her up in an apartment in Buenos Aires . &quot;
The chairman replied , &quot; The Controller has suggested a man named Harry Lantz . &quot;
&quot; That name sounds familiar . &quot;
The chairman said dryly , &quot; Yes . He &apos;s been in the newspapers . Harry Lantz is a maverick . He was thrown out of the CIA for setting up his own drug business in Vietnam . While he was with the CIA , he did a tour in South America , so he knows the territory . He &apos;d be a perfect go - between . &quot; He paused . &quot; I suggest we take a vote . All those in favor of hiring Angel , please raise your hands . &quot;
Eight well - manicured hands went into the air .
&quot; Then it &apos;s settled . &quot; The chairman rose . &quot; The meeting is adjourned . Please observe the usual precautions . &quot;
It was a Monday , and Constable Leslie Hanson was having a picnic in the greenhouse on the castle &apos;s grounds , where he had no right to be . He was not alone , he later had to explain to his superiors . It was warm in the greenhouse , and his companion , Annie , a buxom country lass , had prevailed upon the good constable to bring a picnic hamper .
&quot; You supply the food , &quot; Annie giggled , &quot; and I &apos;ll supply the dessert . &quot;
The &quot; dessert &quot; was five feet six inches , with beautiful , shapely breasts and hips that a man could sink his teeth into .
Unfortunately , in the middle of dessert Constable Hanson &apos;s concentration was distracted by a limousine driving out of the castle gate .
&quot; Don &apos;t lose your place , &quot; Annie coaxed .
Twenty minutes later , the constable heard a second car leaving . This time he was curious enough to get up and peer out the window .
&quot; Right . I just can &apos;t figure out who could be in the castle . Except for tour days , it &apos;s closed down . &quot;
&quot; Exactly what &apos;s going to happen to me , love , if you don &apos;t hop it . &quot;
Twenty minutes later , when Constable Hanson heard the third car leave , his libido lost out to his instincts as a policeman . There were five more vehicles , all limousines , all spaced twenty minutes apart . Because one of the cars stopped long enough to let a deer run by , Constable Hanson was able to note the license - plate number .
&quot; This could be important , &quot; the constable said . And even as he said it , he wondered whether he was going to report it .
&quot; What were you doing at Claymore Castle
&quot; Sergeant Twill demanded .
&quot; Sight - seeing , sir . &quot;
&quot; The castle was closed . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . The greenhouse was open . &quot;
&quot; So you decided to sight - see in the greenhouse
&quot; Spare me the grotty details , Constable . What made you suspicious of the cars
&quot; Cars don &apos;t behave , Hanson . Drivers do . &quot;
&quot; Of course , sir . The drivers seemed very cautious . The cars left at intervals of twenty minutes . &quot;
&quot; You are aware , of course , that there are probably a thousand innocent explanations . In fact , Hanson , the only one who doesn &apos;t seem to have an innocent explanation is yourself . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . But I thought I should report this . &quot;
&quot; Right . Is this the license number you got
&quot; Very well . Be off with you . &quot; He thought of one witticism to add . &quot; Remember &#93; it &apos;s dangerous to throw stones at people if you &apos;re in a glass house . &quot; He chuckled at his bon mot all morning .
When the report on the license plate came back , Sergeant Twill decided that Hanson had made a mistake .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t have bothered you with this , Inspector , but the license - plate number &#93; &quot;
&quot; Yes . I see . I &apos;ll take care of it . &apos; &quot;
At SIS Headquarters , Inspector Pakula had a brief meeting with one of the senior heads of the British Secret Intelligence Service , a beefy , florid - faced man , Sir Alex Hyde - White .
&quot; You were quite right to bring this to my attention , &quot; Sir Alex smiled , &quot; but I &apos;m afraid it &apos;s nothing more sinister than trying to arrange a royal vacation trip without the press being aware of it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry to have bothered you about this . &quot; Inspector Pakula rose to his feet .
&quot; Not at all , Inspector . Shows your branch is on its toes . What did you say the name of that young constable was
&quot; Hanson , sir . Leslie Hanson . &quot;
&quot; I have a message for Balder . We have a small problem . I &apos;ll explain it at the next meeting . Meanwhile , I want you to arrange for three transfers . Police Sergeant Twill , an Inspector Pakula , and Constable Leslie Hanson . Spread them out a few days . I want them sent to separate posts , as far from London as possible . I &apos;ll inform the Controller and see if he wants to take any further action . &quot;
In his hotel room in New York , Harry Lantz was awakened in the middle of the night by the ringing of the telephone .
He looked blearily at the bedside clock , then snatched up the phone . &quot; It &apos;s four o &apos;fucking clock in the morning
&quot; Yes , sir , &quot; he said . &quot; Yes , sir…No , sir , but I can arrange to make myself free . &quot; He listened for a long time . Finally he said , &quot; Yes , sir . I understand . I &apos;ll be on the first plane to Buenos Aires . Thank you , sir . &quot;
What the hell is going down
Harry Lantz asked himself . Something big . The man was going to pay him fifty thousand dollars to deliver a message . It would be fun going back to Argentina . Harry Lantz loved the South American women .
At nine A.M. Lantz picked up the telephone and dialed the number of Aerolíneas Argentinas . &quot; What time is your first flight to Buenos Aires
The 747 arrived at Ezeiza Airport in Buenos Aires at five P.M. the following afternoon . It had been a long flight , but Harry Lantz had not minded it .
As Harry Lantz stepped out of the plane , the blast of hot air startled him for a moment . Of course . It &apos;s summer here .
During the taxi ride into the city , Lantz was amused to see that the graffiti scrawled on the sides of buildings and sidewalks had not changed .
Yes , it was good to be back .
When the taxi arrived at the Hotel El Conquistador in the heart of the fashionable Barrio Norte sector , Lantz paid the driver with a million - peso note .
&quot; Keep the change , &quot; he said . Their money was a joke .
He registered at the desk in the huge , modern lobby , picked up a copy of the Buenos Aires Herald and La Prensa , and let the assistant manager show him to his suite . Sixty dollars a day for a bedroom , bathroom , living room , and kitchen , air - conditioned , with television . In Washington , this setup would cost an arm and a leg , Harry Lantz thought . I &apos;ll take care of my business with this Neusa broad tomorrow , and stay around a few days and enjoy myself .
It was more than two weeks before Harry Lantz was able to track down Neusa Muñez .
His search began with the city telephone directories . Lantz started with the places in the heart of the city : Area Constitution , Plaza San Martin , Barrio Norte , Catelinas Norte . None of them had a listing for a Neusa Muñez . Nor was there any listing in the outlying areas of Bahía Blanca or Mar del Plata .
Lantz wondered . He took to the streets , looking up old contacts .
Por dios &#93; I heard you were dead . &quot;
&quot; I was , but I missed you so much , Antonio , I came back . &quot;
&quot; What are you doing in Buenos Aires
&quot; I came here to find an old girl friend . We were supposed to get married , but her family moved away and I lost track of her . Her name is Neusa Muñez . &quot;
The bartender scratched his head . &quot; Never heard of her . Lo siento . &quot;
Lantz &apos;s next stop was to see a friend at police headquarters .
&quot; Hello , Jorge . Nice to see you , amigo . &quot;
&quot; Last I heard about you , the CIA kicked you out . &quot;
&quot; I opened up my own detective agency . As a matter of fact , that &apos;s what brings me to Buenos Aires . A client of mine died a few weeks ago . He left his daughter a bundle of money , and I &apos;m trying to locate her . All the information I have on her is that she lives in an apartment somewhere in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; Sorry , amigo . I can &apos;t help you . She is not in our computer or in any of our files . &quot;
&quot; Oh , well . If you should come across any information about her , I &apos;m at the El Conquistador . &quot;
The bars were next . Old familiar haunts . The Pepe Gonzalez and Almeida , Café Tabac .
The answer was the same everywhere . No one has ever heard of the fucking broad .
Harry Lantz wandered around La Boca , the colorful waterfront area where one could see old ships rusting at anchor in the river . No one around there knew of Neusa Muñez . For the first time , Harry Lantz began to feel he might be on a wild - goose chase .
It was at the Pilar , a small bar in the barrios of Floresta , that his luck suddenly changed . It was a Friday night and the bar was filled with workingmen . It took Lantz ten minutes to get the bartender &apos;s attention . Before Lantz was halfway through his prepared speech , the bartender said
The following evening , Harry Lantz returned to the Pilar at eleven o &apos;clock , watching the bar gradually fill up . As midnight approached , he found himself getting more and more nervous . What if she did not show up
Lantz watched as a group of giggling young women came into the bar . They joined some men at a table .
He wondered what she looked like . She had to be a stunner . He was authorized to offer her boyfriend , Angel , a cool two million dollars to assassinate someone , so Angel was probably up to his ass in millions .
The door opened and Lantz looked up expectantly . A woman was walking in alone . She was middle - aged and unattractive , with a fat , bloated body and huge , pendulous breasts that swayed as she walked . Her face was pockmarked , and she had dyed blond hair , but her dark complexion indicated mestizo blood inherited from an Indian ancestor who had been bedded by a Spaniard . She was dressed in an ill - fitting skirt and sweater meant for a much younger woman .
The woman looked around the bar with vacant , listless eyes . She nodded vaguely to several people and then pushed her way through the crowd . She walked up to the bar .
&quot; She had a heavy Spanish accent , and up close she was even more unattractive .
She looks like a fat , unmilked cow , Lantz thought . And she &apos;s drunk .
&quot; Esteban say you are lookin &apos; for me , no
He stared at her .
Harry Lantz still could not accept it .
&quot; Sí . Yo soy Neusa Muñez . &quot;
But the wrong one , Harry Lantz thought . Shit
&quot; Are you Angel &apos;s friend
&quot; Well , well . &quot; He forced a smile . &quot; Can we go to a corner table and talk
They fought their way across the smoky bar , and when they were seated , Harry Lantz said
&quot; You buy me a rum , sí
A waiter appeared , wearing a filthy apron , and Lantz said
Muñez said , &quot; Make mine a double , huh
When the waiter left , Lantz turned to the woman seated beside him .
She studied him with her dull , watery eyes .
&quot; Yeah . &quot; She downed her drink in one gulp . &quot; Wha &apos; for you wanna give Angel two million dollars
&quot; That &apos;s something I &apos;ll have to discuss with him in person . &quot;
&quot; Tha &apos;s not possible . Angel , he don &apos; talk to nobody . &quot;
&quot; Lady , for two million dollars &#93; &quot;
My God , she already looks like she &apos;s about to pass out .
&quot; Sure . &quot; Lantz summoned the waiter and ordered the drink . &quot; Have you known Angel a long time
&quot; He made his tone casual .
&quot; He must be an interesting man . &quot;
Her vacant eyes were fixed on a spot on the table in front of her .
Harry Lantz thought . It &apos;s like trying to have a conversation with a fucking wall .
Her drink arrived , and she finished it in one long swallow .
She has the body of a cow and the manners of a pig . &quot; How soon can I talk to Angel
Neusa Muñez struggled to her feet . &quot; I tol &apos; you , he don &apos; talk to nobody . Adios . &quot;
She stopped and looked down at him with bleary eyes . &quot; What you wan &apos;
&quot; Sit down , &quot; Lantz said slowly , &quot; and I &apos;ll tell you what I want . &quot;
What the fuck kind of man is this Angel
His mistress is not only the ugliest broad in all of South America , but she &apos;s a lush .
Lantz did not like dealing with drunks . They were too unreliable . On the other hand , he hated the thought of losing his fifty - thousand - dollar commission . He watched as Muñez gulped her drink . He wondered how many she had had before coming to meet him .
Lantz smiled and said reasonably , &quot; Neusa , if I can &apos;t talk to Angel , how can I do business with him
&quot; Ess simple . You tell me what you wan &apos; . I tell Angel . If he say si , I tell you si . If he say no , I tell you no . &quot;
Harry Lantz distrusted using her as a go - between , but he had no choice . &quot; You &apos;ve heard of Marin Groza . &quot;
Of course she hadn &apos;t . Because it wasn &apos;t the name of a rum . This stupid bitch was going to get the message all wrong and screw up the deal for him .
&quot; Angel will know who Groza is . You just say Marin Groza . He &apos;ll know . &quot;
She was even stupider than she looked . What the fuck did she think Angel was supposed to do for two million dollars
&quot; Yeah . My baby &apos;s outa town . I &apos;ll call him tonight an &apos; meet you here tomorrow . Kin I have &apos;nother rum
Neusa Muñez was turning out to be a nightmare .
The following evening , Harry Lantz sat at the same table in the bar from midnight until four in the morning , when the bar closed . Muñez did not appear .
&quot; Do you know where she lives
The bartender looked at him with innocent eyes .
The bitch had fouled everything up . How could a man who was supposed to be as smart as Angel get hooked up with such a rum dummy
Harry Lantz prided himself on being a pro . He was too smart to walk into a deal like this without first checking it out . He had cautiously asked around , and the information that impressed him most was that the Israelis had put a price of a million dollars on Angel &apos;s head . A million bucks would buy a lifetime worth of booze and young hookers . Well , he could forget about that and he could forget about his fifty thousand . His only link to Angel had been broken . He would have to call The Man and tell him he had failed .
I won &apos;t call him yet , Harry Lantz decided . Maybe she &apos;ll come back here . Maybe the other bars will run out of rum . Maybe I should have had my ass kicked for saying yes to this fucking assignment .
The following night at eleven o &apos;clock , Harry Lantz was seated at the same table in the Pilar , intermittently chewing peanuts and his fingernails . At two A.M. he saw Neusa Muñez stumble in the door , and Harry &apos;s heart soared . He watched as she made her way over to his table .
&quot; Hi , &quot; she mumbled , and slumped into a chair .
&quot; Harry demanded . It was all he could do to control his anger .
&quot; You were supposed to meet me here last night . &quot;
&quot; Oh . I went to a movie with a girlfrien &apos; . There &apos;s this new movie , see
Ess &apos;bout this man who falls in love with this fuckin &apos; nun an &apos; &#93; &quot;
Lantz was so frustrated he could have wept . What could Angel possibly see in this dumb , drunken bitch
He ordered a double rum for her and a double Scotch for himself . He needed it desperately .
&quot; He no longer gave a damn about his messenger - boy mission . He had thought of a better idea . This drunken bitch was going to lead him to Angel . One million dollars reward money .
He watched her slop down her drink , spilling some of it down her already soiled blouse .
&quot; Angel , he say he wanna know who your people are . &quot;
&quot; You tell him that &apos;s confidential , Neusa . I can &apos;t give him that information . &quot;
&quot; Then Angel say to tell you to fuck off . Kin I have a rum &apos;fore I go
&quot; I &apos;ll tell you what I &apos;ll do , Neusa . I &apos;ll telephone the people I &apos;m working for , and if they give me permission , I &apos;ll give you a name . Okay
&quot; No , &quot; Lantz explained patiently , &quot; but Angel does . So you tell him I &apos;ll have an answer for him by tomorrow . Is there someplace I can reach you
Her drink arrived , and he watched her gulp it down like an animal .
Lantz made the telephone call collect , so it could not be traced , from a public - telephone booth on Calvo Street .
&quot; No , &quot; the Controller said . &quot; I told you that no names are to be mentioned . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . But there &apos;s a problem . Neusa Muñez , Angel &apos;s mistress , says he &apos;s willing to make a deal , but he won &apos;t move without knowing who he &apos;s dealing with . Naturally , I told her I had to check it out with you first . &quot;
&quot; What is this woman like
&quot; She &apos;s fat and ugly and stupid , sir . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s much too dangerous for my name to be used . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir , &quot; he said earnestly . &quot; I understand . The only thing is , sir , Angel &apos;s reputation is based on his being able to keep his mouth shut . If he ever started talking , he wouldn &apos;t last five minutes in his business . &quot;
&quot; You have a point . &quot; There was another silence , even longer . &quot; Very well . You may give Angel my name . But he is never to divulge it , and never to contact me directly . He &apos;ll work only through you . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . I &apos;ll tell him . Thank you , sir . &quot;
When Harry Lantz met Neusa Muñez late that evening , he immediately ordered a double rum for her and said , happily
She looked at him indifferently .
He told her the name of his employer . It was a household word , and he expected her to be impressed .
&quot; Never hearda him . &quot;
&quot; Neusa , the people I work for want this done as quickly as possible . Marin Groza is hiding out in a villa in Neuilly , and &#93; &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a little town outside of Paris . Angel will know . &quot;
Not that she needs much encouragement
Lantz thought . When she &apos;s drunk enough , she &apos;s going to lead me to her boyfriend . The rest will be easy .
He looked over at Neusa Muñez staring filmy - eyed into her drink .
It shouldn &apos;t be hard to catch Angel . He may be tough , but he can &apos;t be very bright .
She focused her watery eyes on him .
&quot; Why don &apos;t you and I go back to your place
Neusa Muñez lived in a shabby two - room apartment in the Belgrano district of Buenos Aires . The apartment was messy and unkempt , like its tenant . When they walked through the door , Neusa made straight for the little bar in the corner . She was unsteady on her feet .
She &apos;s the most ugly , repulsive bitch I &apos;ve ever met , he thought , but the million dollars is going to be beautiful .
He looked around the apartment . There were some books piled on a coffee table . He picked them up , one by one , hoping to get an insight into Angel &apos;s mind . The titles surprised him : Gabriela , Clove &amp; Cinnamon , by Jorge Amado ; Fire from the Mountain , by Omar Cabezas ; One Hundred Years of Solitude , by Gabriel García Marquez ; At Night the Cats , by Antonio Cisneros . So Angel was an intellectual . The books did not fit with the apartment or the woman .
&quot; You &apos;re damned cute , do you know that
&quot; He reached up and stroked her breasts . They were the size of watermelons . Lantz hated big - breasted women . &quot; You &apos;ve got a really great body . &quot;
&quot; Her eyes were glazed .
Lantz &apos;s arms moved down and stroked her fat thighs through the thin cotton dress she wore .
But he knew he had to make his move carefully . If he offended her , she might go back and report him to Angel , and that would be the end of the deal .
As Lantz was desperately trying to think of a clever gambit , Neusa mumbled
She was stumbling as Lantz followed her into the small bedroom . It contained one closet with the door ajar , a large unmade bed , two chairs , and a bureau with a cracked mirror above it . It was the closet that caught Harry Lantz &apos;s attention . In it he glimpsed a row of men &apos;s suits hanging on a rack .
She &apos;s the grossest thing I &apos;ve ever seen , Lantz thought . Think positively , Lantz told himself . This will be over in a few minutes . The million bucks will last forever .
Slowly , he forced himself to get undressed . She was propped up in bed like a leviathan , waiting for him , and he crawled in beside her .
Choc &apos;late . I like choc &apos;late . &quot;
She was drunker than he had thought . That &apos;s good . It will make things easier . He began to caress her flabby , fish - white body .
&quot; You &apos;re a very pretty woman , hon . You know that
&quot; I mean &#93; being Angel &apos;s girl friend . That must be really interesting . Tell me , baby , what &apos;s Angel like
&quot; Rich . Angel , he &apos;s rich . &quot;
Lantz &apos;s hand continued its work .
&quot; Yeah . Angel &apos;s good t &apos; me . &quot;
He started thinking about the Dolly sisters and some of the things they had done to him . He visualized them working on his naked body with their tongues and fingers and nipples
He began moving his hips back and forth &quot; Tell me about Angel . Who are his friends
&quot; Angel got no frens . I &apos;m his fren . &quot;
&quot; Of course you are , babe . Does Angel live here with you , or does he have his own place
&quot; Hey , I &apos;m sleepy . When you gonna come
Never , he thought .
He rolled off her and lay at her side , fuming . Why couldn &apos;t Angel have had a normal mistress
Then he would have had no trouble getting the information he needed . But this stupid bitch &#93;
Lantz lay there quietly for a long time , until he was certain Neusa was asleep . Then he carefully arose from the bed and padded over to the closet . He switched the closet light on and closed the door so the light would not awaken the snoring behemoth .
A warning sounded in his mind . No . No questions . He had to be more clever than that . He was , after all , dealing with a world - class assassin . It would be safer to let Neusa lead him to Angel . Then all I have to do is tip off my friends in the Mossad and collect the reward . I &apos;ll show Ned Tillingast and the rest of the fucking CIA bunch that old Harry Lantz hasn &apos;t lost his touch . All the bright boys have been chasing their asses trying to find Angel , and I &apos;m the only one smart enough to pull it off .
He thought he heard a sound from the bed . He carefully peeked out of the closet door , but Neusa was still asleep .
Lantz turned out the closet light and walked over to the bed . Muñez &apos;s eyes were closed . Lantz tiptoed to the bureau and began looking through the drawers , hoping to find a photograph of Angel . That would be a help . No luck . He crept back into bed . Neusa was snoring loudly .
When Harry Lantz finally drifted off to sleep , his dreams were filled with visions of a white yacht crowded with beautiful naked girls with small , firm breasts .
In the morning when Harry Lantz awoke , Neusa was gone . For an instant , Lantz panicked . Had she already left to meet Angel
He heard noises in the kitchen .
&quot; Wan &apos; coffee
&quot; Neusa mumbled . &quot; I can &apos;t fix no breakfast .
With Angel . Harry Lantz tried to hide his excitement . &quot; That &apos;s fine . I &apos;m not hungry . Why don &apos;t you go and keep your appointment and we &apos;ll meet for dinner tonight .
&quot; I don &apos; care . &quot;
&quot; Do you know Chiquín on Avenida Cangallo
&quot; You &apos;ll like it . Why don &apos;t I pick you up here at eight o &apos;clock
I have a lot of business to attend to today .
It took all his willpower to lean over and kiss Neusa good - bye . Her lips were flabby and wet and disgusting .
Lantz walked out of the apartment and hailed a taxi . He hoped Neusa was watching from the window .
&quot; Turn right at the next corner , &quot;
When they had turned the corner , Harry Lantz said
The driver looked at him in surprise .
&quot; Right . I have a bad leg . War wound . &quot;
Harry Lantz paid him , then hurried back to a tobacconist shop across from Neusa &apos;s apartment building . He lit a cigarette and waited .
Twenty minutes later , Neusa came out of the apartment building . Harry watched as she waddled down the street , and he followed her at a careful distance . There was no chance of his losing her . It was like following the Lusitania .
Neusa Muñez seemed to be in no hurry . She moved down the Avenida Belgrano , past the Spanish library , and plodded along the Avenida Cordoba . Lantz watched as she walked into Berenes , a leather shop on San Martin . He stood across the street and observed her chatting with a male clerk . Lantz wondered whether the shop could be a connection with Angel .
Neusa came out a few minutes later carrying a small package . Her next stop was at a heladería on Corrientes , for an ice cream . She walked down San Martin , moving slowly . She seemed to be strolling aimlessly with no particular destination in mind .
What the hell happened to her appointment
Lantz wondered . Where is Angel
He did not believe Neusa &apos;s statement that Angel was out of town . His instincts told him that Angel was somewhere nearby .
Were they for her , or was she expecting someone at her apartment for lunch
Someone named Angel .
From a distance , Lantz watched Neusa enter a verdulería and buy fruit and vegetables . He trailed her back to her apartment building .
Harry Lantz watched Neusa &apos;s building from across the street for the next four hours , moving around to make himself as inconspicuous as possible . Finally he decided that Angel was not going to show up .
In the Oval Office at the White House , it was evening . It had been a long day for Paul Ellison . The entire world seemed to be composed of committees and councils and urgent cables and conclaves and sessions and he had not had a moment to himself until now . Well , almost to himself .
&quot; I &apos;m keeping you from your family , Stan . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to talk to you about the Mary Ashley investigation . How is it coming
&quot; It &apos;s almost completed . We &apos;ll have a final check on her by tomorrow or the next day . So far it looks very good . I &apos;m getting excited about the idea . I think it &apos;s going to work . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll make it work . Would you like another drink
&quot; No , thanks . Unless you need me for anything else , I &apos;m taking Barbara to an opening at the Kennedy Center . &quot;
&quot; You go ahead , &quot; Paul Ellison said . &quot; Alice and I are due to entertain some relatives of hers . &quot;
&quot; Please give my love to Alice , &quot; Stanton Rogers said . He rose .
&quot; And you give mine to Barbara . &quot; He watched Stanton Rogers leave . The President &apos;s thoughts turned to Mary Ashley .
When Harry Lantz arrived at Neusa &apos;s apartment that evening to take her out to dinner , there was no answer to his knock . He felt a moment of consternation . Had she walked out on him ?
He tried the door , and it was unlocked . Was Angel here to meet him
Perhaps he had decided to discuss the contract face - to - face . Harry assumed a brisk , businesslike manner and walked in .
Only an echo . He went into the bedroom . Neusa was lying across the bed , drunk .
&quot; You dumb &#93; &quot; He caught himself . He must not forget that this stupid , drunken broad was his gold mine . He put his hands on her shoulders and tried to rouse her .
&quot; I &apos;m worried about you , &quot; Lantz said . His voice throbbed with sincerity . &quot; I hate to see you unhappy , and I think you &apos;re drinking because someone is making you unhappy . I &apos;m your friend .
&quot; I &apos;m sure he &apos;s a nice man , &quot; Harry Lantz said soothingly . &quot; You two probably just had a little misunderstanding , right
He tried to straighten her out on the bed . It &apos;s like beaching a whale , Lantz thought .
Lantz sat down beside her . &quot; Tell me about Angel , &quot; Lantz said . &quot; What &apos;s he doing to you
Neusa stared up at him , bleary - eyed , trying to focus on him . &quot; Les fuck . &quot;
It was going to be a long night . &quot; Sure . Great idea . &quot; Reluctantly , Lantz began to undress .
When Harry Lantz awakened in the morning alone in bed , memories came flooding into his brain , and he felt sick to his stomach .
Neusa had awakened him in the middle of the night .
&quot; You know wha &apos; I wan &apos; you to do to me
He had listened in disbelief , but he did the things she had asked him to do . He could not afford to antagonize her . She was a sick , wild animal , and Lantz wondered whether Angel had ever done those things for her . The thought of what he had gone through made Lantz want to vomit .
He heard Neusa singing off - key in the bathroom . He was not sure he could face her .
Lantz thought . If she doesn &apos;t tell me this morning where Angel is , I &apos;m going to his tailor and shoemaker .
He threw back the covers and went in to Neusa . She was standing in front of the bathroom mirror . Her hair was in fat curlers , and she looked , if possible , even more unattractive than before .
&quot; You and I are going to have a talk , &quot; Lantz said firmly .
&quot; Sure . &quot; Neusa pointed to the bathtub full of water . &quot; I fix a bath for you . When you &apos;re finish &apos; , I fix breakfast . &quot;
Lantz was impatient , but he knew he must not press too hard .
&quot; I make good omelettes . Angel teach me . &quot;
Lantz watched as she started to take the huge , lumpy curlers out of her hair . He stepped into the bathtub .
Neusa picked up a large electric dryer , plugged it in , and began drying her hair .
Lantz lay back in the warm tub thinking : Maybe I should get a gun and take Angel myself . If I let the Israelis do it , there &apos;ll probably be a fucking inquiry into who gets the reward . This way there won &apos;t be any question . I &apos;ll just tell them where to pick up his body .
Neusa said something , but Harry Lantz could barely hear her over the roar of the hair dryer .
&quot; What did you say &quot; he called out .
&quot; I got a presen &apos; for you from Angel . &quot;
She dropped the electric hair dryer into the water and stood there watching as Lantz &apos;s body twitched in a dance of death .
President Paul Ellison put down the last security report on Mary Ashley and said
&quot; I know . I think she &apos;s the perfect candidate . &quot; Of course , State isn &apos;t going to be happy . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll send them a crying towel . Now let &apos;s hope the Senate will back us up . &quot;
Mary Ashley &apos;s office in Kedzie Hall was a small , pleasant room lined with bookcases that were crammed with reference books on Middle European countries . The furniture was sparse , consisting of a battered desk with a swivel chair , a small table at the window piled with examination papers , a ladder - back chair , and a reading lamp . On the wall behind the desk was a map of the Balkans . An ancient photograph of Mary &apos;s grandfather hung on the wall . It had been taken around the turn of the century , and the figure in the photograph was standing in a stiff , unnatural pose , dressed in the clothes of the period . The picture was one of Mary &apos;s treasures . It had been her grandfather who had instilled in her a deep curiosity about Romania . He had told her romantic stories of Queen Marie , and baronesses and princesses ; tales of Albert , the prince consort of England , and Alexander II , czar of Russia , and dozens of other thrilling characters .
Somewhere in our background there is royal blood . If the revolution had not come , you would have been a princess .
She used to have dreams about it .
Mary was in the middle of grading examination papers when the door opened and Dean Hunter walked in .
&quot; It was the first time the dean had ever visited her office .
Mary felt a sudden sense of elation . There could be only one reason for the dean coming here himself : He was going to tell her that the university was giving her tenure .
It was seldom that someone her age received tenure from a university .
&quot; Are you in some kind of trouble , Mrs. Ashley
&quot; Some men from Washington have been to see me , asking questions about you . &quot;
Mary Ashley heard the echo of Florence Schiffer &apos;s words : Some federal agent from Washington… He was asking all kinds of questions about Mary . He made her sound like some kind of international spy… Was she a loyal American
Was she a good wife and a good mother
&quot; They inquired about your reputation as a professor , and they asked questions about your personal life . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t explain it . I really don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on . I &apos;m in no kind of trouble at all . As far as I know
He was watching her with obvious skepticism .
&quot; Didn &apos;t they tell you why they were asking questions about me
&quot; No . As a matter of fact , I was asked to keep the conversation in strict confidence . But I have a loyalty to my staff , and I felt it only fair that you should be informed about this . If there is something I should know , I would prefer to hear it from you . Any scandal involving one of our professors would reflect badly on the university . &quot;
&quot; I &#93; I really can &apos;t think of anything . &quot;
He looked at her a moment , as though about to say something else , then nodded .
She watched him walk out of her office and wondered :
Mary was very quiet during dinner . She wanted to wait until Edward finished eating before she broke the news of this latest development . They would try to figure out the problem together . The children were being impossible again . Beth refused to touch her dinner .
&quot; No one eats meat anymore . It &apos;s a barbaric custom carried over from the caveman . Civilized people don &apos;t eat live animals . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s not alive , &quot; Tim argued . &quot; It &apos;s dead , so you might as well eat it . &quot;
&quot; Mary &apos;s nerves were on edge . &quot; Not another word . Beth , go make yourself a salad . &quot;
&quot; She could go graze in the field , &quot; Tim offered .
You finish your dinner . &quot; Her head was beginning to pound . &quot; Edward &#93; &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s for me , &quot; Beth said . She leaped out of her chair and raced toward the telephone . She picked it up and said seductively
&quot; She listened a moment , and her expression changed . &quot; Oh , sure , &quot; she said disgustedly . She slammed down the receiver and returned to the table .
&quot; Some practical joker . He said it was the White House calling Mom . &quot;
As she listened , her face grew grim . &quot; We &apos;re in the middle of dinner , and I don &apos;t happen to think this is funny . You can just &#93; what
Edward was on his feet , moving toward the phone , the children close behind him .
&quot; There must be some mistake , Mr. President . My name is Mary Ashley . I &apos;m a professor at Kansas State University , and &#93; You read it
Thank you , sir… That &apos;s very kind of you… Yes , I believe it is… &quot; She listened for a long time . &quot; Yes , sir , I agree . But that doesn &apos;t mean that I…Yes , sir . Yes , sir . I see . Well , I &apos;m certainly flattered . I &apos;m sure it &apos;s a wonderful opportunity , but I…Of course I will . I &apos;ll talk it over with my husband and get back to you . &quot; She picked up a pen and wrote down a number . &quot; Yes , sir . I have it . Thank you , Mr. President . Good - bye . &quot;
She slowly replaced the receiver and stood there in shock .
Mary sank into a chair .
Edward took Mary &apos;s hand in his .
Mary sat there , numb , thinking : So that &apos;s what all the questioning has been about .
She looked up at Edward and the children and said slowly , &quot; The President read my book and the article of mine in Foreign Affairs magazine , and he thought it was brilliant . He said that &apos;s the kind of thinking he wants for his people - to - people program . He wants to nominate me as ambassador to Romania . &quot;
There was a look of total disbelief on Edward &apos;s face .
It was exactly what Mary had asked herself , but she felt that Edward could have been more tactful . He could have said , &quot; How wonderful
You &apos;d make a great ambassador . &quot; But he was being realistic .
&quot; You haven &apos;t had any political experience . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m well aware of that , &quot; Mary responded tartly . &quot; I agree that the whole thing is ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; Are you going to be the ambassador
&quot; Tim asked . &quot; Are we moving to Rome
&quot; You two finish your dinner . Your mother and I would like to have a little talk . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t we get a vote
Edward took Mary &apos;s arm and led her into the library . He turned to her and said ,
&quot; No . You were perfectly right , Edward . Why on earth should they have chosen me
When Mary called him Edward , he knew he was in trouble .
&quot; Honey , you &apos;d probably make a great ambassador , or ambassadress , or whatever they call it these days . But you must admit it came as a bit of a shock . &quot;
&quot; Try thunderbolt . &quot; She sounded like a little girl . &quot; I still can &apos;t believe it . &quot; She laughed . &quot; Wait until I tell Florence . She &apos;ll die . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re really excited about this , aren &apos;t you
Edward chose his words carefully . &quot; It is a great honor , honey , and I &apos;m sure it &apos;s not one they would offer lightly . They must have had good reason for choosing you . &quot; He hesitated . &quot; We have to think about this very carefully . About what it would do to our lives . &quot;
Edward &apos;s right . Of course he &apos;s right .
&quot; I can &apos;t just leave my practice and walk out on my patients . I have to stay here . I don &apos;t know how long you &apos;d have to be away , but if it really means a lot to you , well , maybe we could work out some way where you could go over there with the children and I could join you whenever &#93; &quot;
&quot; You crazy man . Do you think I could live away from you
&quot; Well &#93; it &apos;s an awfully big honor , and &#93; &quot;
&quot; So is being your wife . Nothing means as much to me as you and the children . I would never leave you . This town can &apos;t find another doctor like you , but all the government has to do to find a better ambassador than me is to look in the Yellow Pages . &quot;
&quot; I just called Virgil and told him you &apos;re going to be an ambassador . &quot;
&quot; Then you &apos;d better call him back and tell him I &apos;m not . &quot;
&quot; Your mother has decided she &apos;s going to stay here . &quot;
&quot; Beth wailed . &quot; I &apos;ve never been to Romania . I &apos;ve never been anywhere . &quot;
&quot; I told you we &apos;re never going to escape from this place . &quot;
The following morning Mary dialed the telephone number that the President had given her . When an operator answered , Mary said ,
A male voice on the other end said
&quot; Yes , &quot; Mary said . &quot; Would you please give the President a message for me
&quot; Would you please tell him that I &apos;m very , very flattered by his offer , but my husband &apos;s profession ties him down here , so I &apos;m afraid it would be impossible for me to accept . I hope he understands . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll pass on your message , &quot; the voice said noncommittally . &quot; Thank you , Mrs. Ashley . &quot; The line went dead .
Mary slowly replaced the receiver . It was done . For one brief moment , a tantalizing dream had been offered her . But that was all it was . I &apos;d better get ready for my next political science class .
The whitewashed stone house was anonymous , hidden among dozens of identical houses a short walk from the souks , the large , colorful outdoor markets . It was owned by a merchant sympathetic to the cause of the organization known as the Patriots for Freedom .
&quot; We will need it for only one day , &quot; a voice over the telephone had told him .
It was arranged . Now the chairman was speaking to the men gathered in the living room .
&quot; A problem has arisen , &quot; the chairman said .
&quot; The go - between we selected &#93; Harry Lantz &#93; is dead . &quot;
&quot; He was murdered . His body was found floating in the harbor in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; Do the police have any idea who did it
I mean &#93; can they connect this to us in any way
&quot; No . We &apos;re perfectly safe . &quot;
&quot; What about our plan
Can we go ahead with it
&quot; Not at the moment . We have no idea how to reach Angel . However , the Controller gave Harry Lantz permission to reveal his name to him . If Angel is interested in our proposition , he will find a way to get in touch with him . All we can do now is wait . &quot;
The banner headline in the Junction City Daily Union read : JUNCTION CITY &apos;S MARY ASHLEY DECLINES AMBASSADORSHIP.
There was a two - column story about Mary , and a photograph of her . On KJCK , the afternoon and evening broadcasts carried feature stories on the town &apos;s new celebrity . The fact that Mary Ashley had rejected the President &apos;s offer made the story even bigger than if she had accepted it . In the eyes of its proud citizens , Junction City , Kansas , was a lot more important than Bucharest , Romania .
When Mary Ashley drove into town to shop for dinner , she kept hearing her name on the car radio .
&quot; …Earlier , President Ellison had announced that the ambassadorship to Romania would be the beginning of his people - to - people program , the cornerstone of his foreign policy . How Mary Ashley &apos;s refusal to accept the post will reflect on &#93; &quot;
She switched to another station .
&quot; …is married to Dr . Edward Ashley , and it is believed that &#93; &quot;
Mary switched off the radio . She had received at least three dozen phone calls that morning from friends , neighbors , students , and curious strangers . Reporters had called from as far away as London and Tokyo .
She drove the station wagon into a Derby gas station and pulled up in front of the self - service pump .
As Mary got out of the car , Mr. Blount , the station manager , hurried over to her .
&quot; Thanks . I &apos;m used to doing it . &quot;
When the tank was filled , Mary drove down Washington Street and parked in front of the Shoe Box .
&quot; Mornin &apos; , Mrs. Ashley , &quot; the clerk greeted her . &quot; How &apos;s the ambassador this mornin &apos;
This is going to get tiresome , Mary thought . Aloud , she said , &quot; I &apos;m not an ambassador , but I &apos;m fine , thank you . &quot; She handed him a pair of shoes .
&quot; Ain &apos;t these the ones we did last week
Mary sighed . &quot; And the week before . &quot;
&quot; I jest heard your name on the radio . You &apos;re puttin &apos; Junction City on the map . Yes , sir . I guess you and Eisenhower and Alf Landon are Kansas &apos;s only political big shots , Mrs. Ambassador . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not an ambassador , &quot; Mary said patiently . &quot; I turned it down . &quot;
It was no use . Mary said , &quot; I need some jeans for Beth . Preferably something in iron . &quot;
&quot; How old is Beth now
&quot; Land &apos;s sake , they grow so fast these days , don &apos;t they
&quot; Beth was born a teenager , Mrs. Hacker . &quot;
&quot; He &apos;s a lot like Beth . &quot;
The shopping took Mary twice as long as usual . Everyone had some comment to make about the big news . She went into Dillon &apos;s to buy some groceries , and was studying the shelves when Mrs. Dillon approached .
&quot; Good morning , Mrs. Dillon . Do you have a breakfast food that has nothing in it
Mary consulted a list in her hand . &quot; No artificial sweeteners , no sodium , fats , carbohydrates , caffeine , caramel coloring , folic acid , or flavorites . &quot;
&quot; Is this some kind of medical experiment
&quot; In a sense . It &apos;s for Beth . She &apos;ll only eat natural foods . &quot;
&quot; Why don &apos;t you just put her out to pasture and let her graze
&quot; That &apos;s what my son suggested . &quot; Mary picked up a package and studied the label . &quot; It &apos;s my fault . I never should have taught Beth how to read . &quot;
Mary drove home carefully , climbing the winding hill toward Milford Lake . It was a few degrees above zero , but the windchill factor brought the temperature down to well below zero , for there was nothing to stop the winds from their biting sweep across the endless plains . The lawns were covered with snow , and Mary remembered the previous winter when an ice storm had swept the county and the ice snapped the power lines . They had no electricity for almost a week . She and Edward made love every night . Maybe we &apos;ll get lucky again this winter , she grinned to herself .
When Mary arrived home , Edward was still at the hospital . Tim was in the study watching a science - fiction program . Mary put away the groceries and went in to confront her son .
&quot; Aren &apos;t you supposed to be doing your homework
&quot; Because I don &apos;t understand it . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re not going to understand it any better by watching Star Trek . Let me see your lesson . &quot;
&quot; These are dumb problems , &quot; Tim said .
&quot; There are no such things as dumb problems . There are only dumb students . Now let &apos;s take a look at this . &quot;
&quot; A train leaving Minneapolis had one hundred and forty - nine people on board . In Atlanta more people boarded the train . Then there were two hundred and twenty - three on the train . How many people boarded in Atlanta
&quot; No , you don &apos;t , &quot; Tim said glumly . &quot; It has to be an equation . One hundred forty - nine plus N equals two hundred twenty - three . N equals two hundred twenty - three minus one hundred forty - nine . N equals seventy - four . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s dumb , &quot; Mary said .
As Mary passed Beth &apos;s room , she heard noises . Mary went in . Beth was seated on the floor , cross - legged , watching television , listening to a rock record , and doing her homework .
&quot; How can you concentrate with all this noise
She walked over to the television set and turned it off and then turned off the record player .
That was George Michael . &quot;
Beth &apos;s room was wallpapered with posters of musicians . There were Kiss and Van Halen , Motley Crue and Aldo Nova and David Lee Roth . The bed was covered with magazines : Seventeen and Teen Idol and half a dozen others . Beth &apos;s clothes were scattered over the floor .
&quot; Beth &#93; how can you live like this
Beth looked up at her mother , puzzled .
She looked at an envelope on her daughter &apos;s desk .
&quot; I &apos;m in love with him . &quot;
&quot; I thought you were in love with George Michael . &quot;
&quot; I burn for George Michael . I &apos;m in love with Rick Springfield . Mother , in your day didn &apos;t you ever burn for anybody
&quot; In my day we were too busy trying to get the covered wagons across the country . &quot;
Beth sighed . &quot; Did you know Rick Springfield had a rotten childhood
&quot; To be perfectly honest , Beth , I was not aware of that . &quot;
&quot; It was awful . His father was in the military and they moved around a lot . He &apos;s a vegetarian too . Like me . He &apos;s awesome . &quot;
So that &apos;s what &apos;s behind Beth &apos;s crazy diet !
&quot; Mother , may I go to a movie Saturday night with Virgil
What happened to Arnold
&quot; Arnold wanted to fool around . He &apos;s dorky . &quot;
&quot; Just because I &apos;m starting to get breasts the boys think I &apos;m easy . Mom , did you ever feel uncomfortable about your body
&quot; Yes , my darling . When I was about your age , I felt very uncomfortable . &quot;
&quot; I hate having my period and getting breasts and hair all over . Why
&quot; It happens to every girl , and you &apos;ll get used to it . &quot;
&quot; No , I won &apos;t . &quot; She pulled away and said fiercely , &quot; I don &apos;t mind being in love , but I &apos;m never going to have sex . Not Arnold or Virgil or Kevin Bacon . &quot;
&quot; Well , if that &apos;s your decision… &quot;
&quot; Definitely . Mom , what did President Ellison say when you told him you weren &apos;t going to be his ambassador
&quot; He was very brave about it , &quot; Mary assured her . &quot; I think I &apos;d better get dinner started . &quot;
Cooking was Mary Ashley &apos;s secret bete noir . She hated to cook , and consequently was not very good at it , and because she liked to be good at everything she did , she hated it even more . It was a vicious circle that had partly been solved by having Lucinda come in three times a week to cook and clean the house . This was one of Lucinda &apos;s days off .
When Edward came home from the hospital , Mary was in the kitchen , burning some peas . She turned off the stove and gave Edward a kiss .
&quot; You &apos;ve been communicating with our daughter , &quot; Edward said . &quot; As a matter of fact , it was dorky . I treated a thirteen - year - old girl this afternoon who had genital herpes . &quot;
&quot; She threw out the peas and opened a can of tomatoes .
&quot; You know , it makes me worry about Beth . &quot;
&quot; You don &apos;t have to , &quot; Mary assured him .
&quot; Dad , can I have a surfboard for my birthday
&#93; I don &apos;t want to rain on your parade , but you happen to live in Kansas . &quot;
&quot; I know that . Johnny invited me to go to Hawaii with him next summer . His folks have a beach house in Maui . &quot;
&quot; Well , &quot; Edward said reasonably , &quot; if Johnny has a beach house , then he probably has a surfboard . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;ll see . Please don &apos;t eat so fast , Tim . Beth , you &apos;re not eating anything . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s nothing here that &apos;s fit for human consumption . &quot; She looked at her parents . &quot; I have an announcement to make . I &apos;m going to change my name . &quot;
&quot; Any particular reason
&quot; I &apos;ve decided to go into show business . &quot;
Mary and Edward exchanged a long , pained look .
&quot; Okay . Find out how much you can get for them . &quot;
In in a scandal that rocked the international secret - service organizations , Mehdi ben Barka , an opponent of King Hassan II of Morocco , was lured to Paris from his exile in Geneva and murdered with the help of the French secret service . It was following this incident that President Charles de Gaulle took the secret service from the control of the premier &apos;s office and placed it under the aegis of the Ministry of Defense . Thus it was that the current minister of defense , Roland Passy , was responsible for the safety of Marin Groza , who had been granted sanctuary by the French government . Gendarmes were stationed in front of the villa in Neuilly on twenty - four - hour shifts , but it was the knowledge that Lev Pasternak was in charge of the villa &apos;s inner security that gave Passy confidence . He had seen the security arrangements himself and was firmly convinced that the house was impregnable .
In recent weeks , rumors had been sweeping the diplomatic world that a coup was imminent , that Marin Groza was planning to return to Romania , and that Alexandras Ionescu was going to be deposed by his senior military officers .
Lev Pasternak knocked on the door and entered the book - crammed library that served as Marin Groza &apos;s office . Groza was seated behind his desk , working . He looked up as Lev Pasternak came in .
&quot; Everybody wants to know when the revolution is going to happen , &quot; Pasternak said . &quot; It &apos;s the world &apos;s worst - kept secret . &quot;
&quot; Tell them to be patient . Will you come to Bucharest with me , Lev
I &apos;ll only take this job temporarily , he had told Marin Groza . Until you &apos;re ready to make your move .
In a world peopled with pygmies , Lev Pasternak thought , I have been given the privilege of serving a giant . Marin Groza was the most selfless and idealistic man Lev Pasternak had ever known .
&quot; Groza was betrayed . The Securitate picked him up and tortured him for five days . They promised to free him if he would give them the names of his associates in the underground . He wouldn &apos;t talk . They arrested his wife and his fourteen - year - old daughter and brought them to the interrogation room . Groza was given a choice : Talk or watch them die . It was the hardest decision any man ever had to make . It was the lives of his beloved wife and child against the lives of hundreds of people who believed in him . &quot; The man paused , then went on more slowly . &quot; I think in the end what made Groza decide the way he did was that he was convinced that he and his family were going to be killed anyway . He refused to give them the names . The guards strapped him in a chair and forced him to watch his wife and daughter being gangraped until they died . But they weren &apos;t through with Groza yet . When it was over and their bloody bodies were lying at his feet , they castrated him . &quot;
&quot; The most important thing for you to understand is that Marin Groza does not want to return to Romania to seek vengeance . He wants to make certain that such things can never again happen . &quot;
Lev Pasternak had been with Groza from that day on , and the more time he spent with the revolutionary , the more he came to love him . Now , he would have to decide whether to give up his return to Israel and go to Romania with Groza .
Pasternak was walking down the hallway that evening , and as he passed Marin Groza &apos;s bedroom door , he heard the familiar screams of pain ring out . So it &apos;s Friday , Pasternak thought . The day the prostitutes came . They were selected from England , North America , Brazil , Japan , Thailand , and half a dozen other countries , chosen at random . They had no idea what their destination was , or who they were going to see . They were met at Charles de Gaulle Airport , driven directly to the villa , and , after a few hours , taken back to the airport and put on a return flight .
The telephone call came ten days after Harry Lantz &apos;s body was found . The Controller was in the middle of a staff meeting in the conference room when the intercom buzzer sounded .
&quot; I know you asked not to be disturbed , sir , but there &apos;s an overseas call for you . It sounds urgent . A Miss Neusa Munez is calling from Buenos Aires . I told her &#93; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll take the call in my private office . &quot; He excused himself , went into his office , and locked the door .
&quot; Yeah . &quot; It was a voice with a South American accent , coarse and uneducated . &quot; I got a message for you from Angel . He din &apos; like the nosy messenger you sent . &quot;
He had to choose his words carefully . &quot; I &apos;m sorry . But we would still like Angel to go ahead with our arrangement . Would that be possible
&quot; Yeah . He say he wanna do it . &quot;
The man held back a sigh of relief . &quot; Excellent . How shall I arrange his advance
&quot; Oh , yeah . The number is &#93; Jesus . I forgot . Hol &apos; on . I got it here somewhere . &quot; He heard the rustle of papers , and finally she was back on the telephone . &quot; Here it is . J - three - four - nine - zero - seven - seven . &quot;
He repeated the number . &quot; How soon can he handle the matter
&quot; When he &apos;s ready , señor . Angel say you &apos;ll know when &apos;ees done . You &apos;ll read &apos;bout it in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Very well . I &apos;m going to give you my private telephone number in case Angel needs to reach me . &quot;
The meeting was being held in an isolated dacha bordering on the River Kura .
The chairman said , &quot; Two urgent matters have arisen . The first is good news . The Controller has had word from Angel . The contract is moving forward . &quot;
&quot; Freyr exclaimed . &quot; What &apos;s the bad news
&quot; I &apos;m afraid it concerns the President &apos;s candidate for the ambassadorship to Romania , but the situation can be handled… &quot;
It was difficult for Mary Ashley to keep her mind on the class . Something had changed . In the eyes of her students she had become a celebrity .
&quot; As we know , 1956 was a watershed year for many of the Eastern European countries . With Gomulka &apos;s return to power , national communism emerged in Poland . In Czechoslovakia Antonin Mavorony led the Communist party . There were no major political changes in Romania that year… &quot;
Romania…Bucharest…From the photographs Mary had seen , it had to be one of the most beautiful cities in Europe . She had not forgotten any of the stories her grandfather had told her about Romania . She remembered how terrified she had been as a little girl by his tales of the horrible Prince Vlad of Transylvania .
Mary was suddenly aware of a deep silence in the room . The class was staring at her .
The class seemed to go on endlessly , but mercifully it was almost over .
&quot; Your homework assignment will be to write an essay on the USSR &apos;s economic planning and management , describing the basic organization of the government organs , and the CPSU control . I want you to analyze the internal and external dimensions of Soviet policy , with emphasis on its positions on Poland , Czechoslovakia , and Romania . &quot;
Romania…Welcome to Romania , Madam Ambassador . Your limousine is here to drive you to your embassy . Her embassy . She had been invited to live in one of the most exciting capitals of the world , reporting to the President , being in the center of his people - to - people concept . I could have been a part of history .
She was roused from her reverie by the sound of the bell . Class was over . Time to go home and change . Edward would be back from the hospital early . He was taking her out to the country club for dinner .
As befitted an almost - ambassador .
&quot; the crackling voice sounded over the loudspeaker throughout the hospital corridors . Even as the emergency crew began to converge on the ambulance entrance , the sound of an approaching siren could be heard . The Geary Community Hospital is an austere - looking three - story brown building perched on a hill on St . Mary &apos;s Road in the southwest section of Junction City . The hospital holds sixty - six beds , and has two modern operating rooms and a series of examining rooms and administrative offices .
It had been an unusually busy Friday , and the ward on the top floor was already filled with injured servicemen who had come to town from nearby Fort Riley , home of the 1st Infantry Division , known as The Big Red One , for their weekend R and R.
Edward Ashley had been a doctor at Geary Memorial Hospital for thirteen years , and before going into private practice he had been an air force flight surgeon with the rank of captain . Several prestigious hospitals in large cities had tried to lure him away , but he preferred to stay where he was .
He finished with the patient he was working on and looked around . There were at least a dozen soldiers waiting to be patched up . He heard the sound of the approaching ambulance siren . &quot; They &apos;re playing our song . &quot;
&quot; It looks like M * A * S * H in here . You &apos;d think we were in some kind of war . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s the only war they have , Doug . That &apos;s why they come into town every weekend and go a little nuts . They &apos;re frustrated . &quot; He finished the last stitch . &quot; There you are , soldier . You &apos;re as good as new .
The patient wore the uniform of a private , and he looked to be no more than eighteen years old . He was in shock . He was sweating profusely and his breathing was labored . Dr . Ashley felt his pulse . It was weak and thready . A splotch of blood stained the front of his uniform jacket . Edward Ashley turned to one of the paramedics who had brought in the patient .
&quot; A knife wound to the chest , Doctor . &quot;
&quot; Let &apos;s see if his lung is collapsed .
&quot; It &apos;s distended . The pericardium &apos;s probably been penetrated . &quot; Which meant that the sac that protected the heart was filled with blood , pressing against the heart so that it could not beat properly .
The nurse who was taking the patient &apos;s blood pressure said ,
The monitor measuring the patient &apos;s electrocardiogram began to slow . They were losing the patient .
Another nurse hurried in with the chest X ray .
The heart had a hole in it . The lung was collapsed .
&quot; Get a tube in him and expand the lung . &quot; His voice was quiet , but there was no mistaking the urgency in it . &quot; Get an anesthesiologist . We &apos;re going to open him up . Intubate him . &quot;
A nurse handed Dr . Schiffer an endotracheal tube . Edward Ashley nodded at him . &quot; Now . &quot;
Douglas Schiffer carefully began to push the tube into the unconscious soldier &apos;s windpipe . There was a bag at the end of the tube , and Schiffer began to squeeze it in a steady rhythm , ventilating the lungs . The monitor began to slow , and the curve on the monitor was completely flat . The smell of death was in the room .
There was no time to wheel the patient up to the operating room . Dr . Ashley had to make an instant decision .
&quot; We &apos;re going to do a thoracotomy . &quot;
There was almost no blood , because the heart was trapped in the pericardium .
The instrument was put in his hands , and he inserted it into the patient &apos;s chest to spread the ribs apart .
He moved closer so that he could reach the pericardial sac . He snipped the scissors into it , and the blood released from the imprisonment of the heart sac spurted out , hitting the nurses and Dr . Ashley . Dr . Ashley reached in and began to massage the heart . The monitor began to beep , and the pulse became palpable . There was a small laceration at the apex of the left ventricle .
&quot; Get him up to the operating room . &quot;
Three minutes later the patient was on the operating table .
&quot; I &apos;ll close , Ed . Why don &apos;t you get cleaned up
Edward Ashley had showered and changed clothes and was in his office writing up the required medical report . It was a pleasant office , filled with bookcases containing medical tomes and athletic trophies . It contained a desk , an easy chair , and a small table with two straight chairs . On the walls were his diplomas , neatly framed .
Edward &apos;s body felt stiff and tired from the tension he had just gone through . At the same time , he felt sexually aroused , as he always did after major surgery . It &apos;s coming face - to - face with death that magnifies the values of the life force , a psychiatrist had once explained to Edward .
He selected a pipe from the pipe rack on his desk , lighted it , and sank into the easy chair and stretched out his legs . Thinking about Mary made him feel guilty . He was responsible for her turning down the President &apos;s offer , and his reasons were valid . But there &apos;s more to it than that , Edward admitted to himself . I was jealous . I reacted like a spoiled brat . What would have happened if the President had made me an offer like that
All I could think of was that I wanted Mary to stay home and take care of me and the kids . Talk about your genuine male chauvinist pig !
Too late , he thought . But I &apos;ll make it up to her . I &apos;ll surprise her this summer with a trip to Paris and London . Maybe I &apos;ll take her to Romania . We &apos;ll have a real honeymoon .
The Junction City Country Club is a three - level limestone building set in the midst of lush hills . The club has an eighteen - hole golf course , two tennis courts , a swimming pool , a bar and dining room with a large fireplace at one end , a card room upstairs , and locker rooms downstairs .
Edward &apos;s father had belonged to the club , as had Mary &apos;s father , and Edward and Mary had been taken there since they were children . The town was a closely knit community , and the country club was its symbol .
When Edward and Mary arrived , it was late , and there was only a sprinkling of guests left in the dining room . They stared , watching as Mary sat down , and whispered to one another . Mary was getting used to it .
Of course there were regrets . But they were castles - in - Spain regrets about the kind of glamorous , impossible dreams that everyone has . If I had been born a princess ; if I were a millionnairess ; if I received the Nobel Prize for curing cancer ; if…if…if…
&quot; None , darling . It was a fluke that they even asked me . Anyhow , there &apos;s no way I would ever leave you or the children . &quot; She took his hand in hers . &quot; No regrets . I &apos;m glad I refused the offer . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m going to make you an offer you can &apos;t refuse . &quot;
In the beginning , when they were first married , their lovemaking had been fierce and demanding . They had a constant physical need for each other that could not be satisfied until they were both completely spent . The urgency had mellowed with time , but the emotions were still there , constant and sweet and fulfilling .
When they returned home now , they undressed without haste and got into bed . Edward held her close to him , then began to stroke her body gently , playing with her breasts , teasing the nipples with his fingers , moving his hand down toward the velvety softness .
She moved on top of him . . . Edward held his wife tightly in his arms .
&quot; I love you twice as much . Good night , darling . &quot;
At three o &apos;clock in the morning , the phone exploded into sound . Edward sleepily reached for the instrument and brought it to his ear .
A woman &apos;s urgent voice said ,
&quot; Pete Grimes is havin &apos; a heart attack . He &apos;s in pain somethin &apos; awful . I think he &apos;s dyin &apos; . I don &apos;t know what to do . &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t do anything . Keep him still . I &apos;ll be there in half an hour .
He looked over at Mary . Her eyes were half open .
&quot; Everything &apos;s fine . Go back to sleep . &quot;
&quot; Mary mumbled . &quot; I think I &apos;m going to feel sexy again . &quot;
Five minutes later , he was on his way to the Grimes farm .
As he drove , he wondered whether he should have called for an ambulance before he left the house . The last two &quot; heart attacks &quot; Pete Grimes had had turned out to be bleeding ulcers .
He turned the car onto Route 18 , the two - lane highway that went through Junction City . The town was asleep , its houses huddled against the bitter , frigid wind .
When Edward came to the end of Sixth Street , he made the turn that took him onto Route 57 and headed toward Grandview Plaza . How many times had he driven over these roads on hot summer days with the sweet smell of corn and prairie hay in the air , past miniature forests of cottonwood trees and cedars and Russian olive trees , and August haystacks piled up alongside the roads
The fields had been filled then with the odor of burning cedar trees that had to be destroyed regularly because they kept taking over the crops . And how many winters had he driven on this road through a frosted landscape , with power lines delicately laced with ice , and lonely smoke from far - off chimneys
He was so lucky . I &apos;ll make everything up to her , Edward promised himself . I &apos;ll give her the damnedest honeymoon any woman ever had .
Edward turned at Route 77 , and as he started into the intersection , a truck appeared out of nowhere . He heard a sudden roar , and his car was pinned by two bright headlights racing toward him . He caught a glimpse of the giant five - ton army truck bearing down on him , and the last sound he heard was his own voice screaming .
Angel drove slowly , but not slowly enough to arouse suspicion , taking everything in . Two guards in front , a high wall , probably electrified , and inside , of course , the usual electronic nonsense of beams , sensors , and alarms . It would take an army to storm the villa .
In Argentina , poor families were very poor , indeed , and Angel &apos;s mother had been one of the unfortunate descamisados . No one knew or cared who the father had been . Through the years Angel had watched friends and relatives die of hunger and sickness and disease . Death was a way of life , and Angel thought philosophically : Since it is going to happen anyway , why not make a profit from it
In the beginning , there were those who doubted Angel &apos;s lethal talents , but those who tried to put roadblocks in the way had a habit of disappearing . Angel &apos;s reputation as an assassin grew . I have never failed , Angel thought . I am Angel . The Angel of Death .
The snow - covered Kansas highway was ablaze with vehicles with flashing red lights that turned the frosty air bloodred . A fire truck , ambulance , tow truck , four highway - patrol cars , a sheriff &apos;s car , and in the center , ringed by headlights , the five - ton M871 army tractor - trailer , and partially beneath it , Edward Ashley &apos;s crumpled car . A dozen police officers and firemen were milling around , swinging their arms and stamping their feet , trying to keep warm in the predawn freeze . In the middle of the highway , covered by a tarpaulin , was a body . A sheriff &apos;s car was approaching , and as it skidded to a stop , Mary Ashley ran out of it . She was trembling so hard that she could barely stand . She saw the tarpaulin and moved toward it .
&quot; I wouldn &apos;t look at him if I were you , Mrs. Ashley . &quot;
Later , she remembered walking up to the house and Sheriff Munster leading her inside . Florence and Douglas Schiffer were waiting for her in the living room . The children were still asleep .
&quot; It &apos;s all right , &quot; Mary said calmly . &quot; Edward had an accident . &quot; She giggled .
&quot; Come on , I &apos;m putting you to bed . &quot;
&quot; It was an accident . Edward was in an accident . &quot;
Douglas Schiffer looked into her eyes . They were wide and vacant . He felt a chill go through him .
He gave her a sedative , helped her into bed , and sat at her side . An hour later , Mary was still awake .
In Junction City there are strict investigative procedures involved in the report of a 1048 &#93; an injury accident . An ambulance is dispatched from the County Ambulance Service , and a sheriff &apos;s officer is sent to the scene . If army personnel are involved in the accident , the CID &#93; the Criminal Investigating Division of the army &#93; conducts an investigation along with the sheriff &apos;s office .
Shel Planchard , a plainclothes officer from the CID headquarters at Fort Riley , and the sheriff and a deputy were examining the accident report in the sheriff &apos;s office on Ninth Street .
&quot; What &apos;s the problem , Sheriff
&quot; Well , looky here . There were five witnesses to the accident , right
A priest and two nuns , Colonel Jenkins , and the truck driver , Sergeant Wallis . Every single one of them says Doc Ashley &apos;s car turned onto the highway , ran the stop sign , and was hit by the army truck . &quot;
&quot; Right , &quot; the CID man said . &quot; What &apos;s bothering you
Sheriff Munster scratched his head . &quot; Mister , have you ever seen an accident report where even two eyewitnesses said the same thing
&quot; He slammed a fist against the papers . &quot; What bothers the hell out of me is that every one of these witnesses says exactly the same thing . &quot;
&quot; It just shows that what happened was pretty obvious . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s somethin &apos; else nigglin &apos; at me . &quot;
&quot; What were a priest and two nuns and a colonel doing out on Highway Seventy - seven at four o &apos;clock in the mornin &apos;
&quot; Nothing mysterious about that . The priest and the sisters were on their way to Leonardville , and the colonel was returning to Fort Riley . &quot;
The sheriff said , &quot; I checked with the DMV. The last ticket Doc Ashley got was six years ago for illegal parking . He had no accident record . &quot;
&quot; Sheriff , just what are you suggesting
&quot; I &apos;m not suggestin &apos; anythin &apos; . I jest have a funny feelin &apos; about this . &quot;
&quot; We &apos;re talking about an accident seen by five witnesses . If you think there &apos;s some kind of conspiracy involved , there &apos;s a big hole in your theory . If &#93; &quot;
&quot; I know . If it wasn &apos;t an accident , all the army truck had to do was knock him off and keep goin &apos; . There wouldn &apos;t be any reason for all these witnesses and rigamarole . &quot;
&quot; Exactly . &quot; The CID man rose and stretched . &quot; Well , I &apos;ve got to get back to the base . As far as I &apos;m concerned , the driver of the truck , Sergeant Wallis , is cleared . &quot; He looked at the sheriff . &quot; Are we in agreement
Mary was awakened by the sound of the children crying . She lay still , her eyes tightly closed , thinking : This is a part of my nightmare . I &apos;m asleep , and when I wake up , Edward will be alive .
But the crying continued . When she could stand it no longer , she opened her eyes and lay there , staring at the ceiling . Finally , reluctantly , she forced herself to get out of bed . She felt drugged . She walked into Tim &apos;s bedroom .
Mary nodded , unable to speak the words . She sat on the edge of the bed .
&quot; I had to tell them , &quot; Florence apologized . &quot; They were going to go off to play with some friends . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s all right . &quot; Mary stroked Tim &apos;s hair . &quot; Don &apos;t cry , darling . Everything is going to be all right . &quot;
The United States Army CID Command at Fort Riley is headquartered at Building 169 , in an old limestone structure surrounded by trees , with steps leading up to the porch of the building . In an office on the first floor , Shel Planchard , the CID officer , was talking to Colonel Jenkins .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid I have some bad news , sir . Sergeant Wallis , the driver of the truck that killed the civilian doctor &#93; &quot;
&quot; He had a fatal heart attack this morning . &quot;
&quot; Yes , sir . His body is being cremated this morning . It was very sudden . &quot;
&quot; Unfortunate . &quot; The colonel rose . &quot; I &apos;m being transferred overseas . &quot; He allowed himself a small smile . &quot; A rather important promotion . &quot;
Mary Ashley decided later that the only thing that saved her sanity was being in a state of shock . Everything that happened seemed to be happening to someone else . She was underwater , moving slowly , hearing voices from a distance , filtered through cotton wool .
The funeral service was held at the Mass - Hinitt - Alexander Funeral Home on Jefferson Street . It was a blue building with a white portico and a large white clock hanging above the entrance . The funeral parlor was filled to overflowing with friends and colleagues of Edward . There were dozens of wreaths and bouquets . One of the largest wreaths had a card that read , simply : &quot; My deepest sympathy . Paul Ellison . &quot;
Mary and Beth and Tim sat alone in the small family room off to one side of the parlor , the children red - eyed and still .
The casket with Edward &apos;s body in it was closed . Mary could not bear to think about the reason .
She and Edward were in the small sailboat on Milford Lake .
&quot; he had asked her the first night they dated .
&quot; I &apos;ve never been sailing . &quot;
&quot; Saturday , &quot; he said . &quot; We have a date . &quot;
They were married one week later .
&quot; Edward teased . &quot; You passed the test . You laughed a lot and you didn &apos;t fall overboard . &quot;
Highland Cemetery on Ash Street is a vast park , with a graveled road circling it . It is the oldest cemetery in Junction City , and many of the headstones have long since been eroded by time and weather . Because of the numbing cold , the graveside ceremony was kept brief .
&quot; I am the resurrection and the life ; he that believeth in me , though he were dead , yet shall he live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die . I am he that liveth and was dead ; and , behold , I am alive forever more . &quot;
Mary and the children stood in the howling wind watching the casket being lowered into the frozen , uncaring earth .
Good - bye , my darling .
Death is supposed to be an ending , but for Mary Ashley it was the beginning of an unbearable hell . She and Edward had talked about death , and Mary thought she had come to terms with it , but now death had suddenly assumed a reality that was immediate and terrifying . It was no longer a vague event that would happen on some far , distant day . There was no way to cope with it . Everything within Mary screamed to deny what had happened to Edward . When he died , everything wonderful died with him . The reality kept hitting her in fresh waves of shock . She wanted to be alone . She cowered deep within herself , feeling like a small , terrified child abandoned by an adult . She found herself raging against God . Why didn &apos;t you take me first
she demanded . She was furious with Edward for deserting her , furious with the children , furious with herself .
Time was spinning by , mocking her emptiness . Her life was like a runaway train over which she had no control .
Florence and Douglas and other friends stayed with her , trying to make things easier , but Mary wished they would go away and leave her alone .
&quot; She didn &apos;t even know I was there , &quot; Florence told her husband that evening . &quot; She was concentrating so desperately on that game . &quot; She shivered . &quot; It was spooky . &quot;
&quot; Mary hates football . It was Edward who watched every game . &quot;
It took Mary &apos;s last ounce of willpower to handle the detritus left by Edward &apos;s death . There was the will , and insurance , and bank accounts and taxes and bills due and Edward &apos;s medical corporation and loans and assets and deficits , and she wanted to scream at the lawyers and bankers and accountants to leave her in peace .
Frank Dunphy , Edward &apos;s accountant , said , &quot; I &apos;m afraid the bills and death taxes are going to use up a lot of the life - insurance money , Mrs. Ashley . Your husband was pretty lax about his patients paying him . He &apos;s owed a lot of money . I &apos;ll arrange for a collection agency to go after the people who owe &#93; &quot;
&quot; No , &quot; Mary said fiercely . &quot; Edward wouldn &apos;t want that . &quot;
&quot; Well , then , I guess the bottom line is that your assets are thirty thousand dollars in cash and this house , which has a mortgage on it . If you sold the house &#93; &quot;
She sat there , stiff and rigid , holding in her misery , and Dunphy thought : I wish to God my wife cared that much about me .
The worst was yet to come . It was time to dispose of Edward &apos;s personal things . Florence offered to help her , but Mary said ,
She went into Edward &apos;s closet and ran her fingers over suits he would never again wear . The blue tie he had worn on their last night together . His gloves and scarf that kept him warm against the winter winds . He would not need them in his cold grave .
She carefully put away his razor and toothbrushes , moving like an automaton . She found love notes they had written to each other , bringing back memories of the lean days when Edward started his own practice , a Thanksgiving dinner without a turkey , summer picnics and winter sleigh rides , and her first pregnancy and both of them reading and playing classical music to Beth while she was in the womb , and the love letter Edward wrote when Tim was born , and the gold - plated apple Edward had given her when she began teaching , and a hundred other wonderful things that brought tears to her eyes . His death was like some cruel magician &apos;s trick .
I &apos;m a mature person . I have to accept reality . I &apos;m not mature . I can &apos;t accept it . I don &apos;t want to live .
She lay awake through the long night , thinking how simple it would be to join Edward , to stop the unbearable agony , to be at peace . We &apos;re brought up to expect a happy ending , Mary thought .
She finally dozed off , and in the middle of the night her wild screams awakened the children , and they ran to her bedside and crawled into bed with her , hugging her .
Mary thought : I can &apos;t kill myself . They need me . Edward would never forgive me .
We &apos;re all so needy without Edward . We need one another so terribly . It &apos;s ironic that Edward &apos;s death is harder to bear because we had such a wonderful life together . There are so many more reasons to miss him , so many memories of things that will never happen again . Where are you , God
Ring Lardner said , &quot; Three out of three are going to die , so shut up and deal . &quot; I have to deal . I &apos;m being terribly selfish . I &apos;m behaving badly , as if I &apos;m the only person in the world who is suffering . God isn &apos;t trying to punish me . Life is a cosmic grab bag . At this moment , somewhere in the world , someone is losing a child , skiing down a mountain , having an orgasm , getting a haircut , lying on a bed of pain , singing on a stage , drowning , getting married , starving in a gutter . In the end , aren &apos;t we all that same person
An aeon is a thousand million years , and an aeon ago every atom in our bodies was a part of a star . Pay attention to me , God . We are all a part of your universe , and if we die , part of your universe dies with us .
He was in the songs Mary heard on the radio , in the hills they had driven through together . He was in bed at her side when she awoke at sunrise .
Got to get up early this morning , honey . I have a hysterectomy and a hip operation .
I &apos;m worried about the children , Edward . They don &apos;t want to go to school . Beth says they &apos;re afraid that when they get home I won &apos;t be here .
Mary went to visit the cemetery every day , standing in the icy air , mourning for what was lost to her forever . But it gave her no comfort .
&quot; How Wang - Fô Was Saved . &quot; It was the tale of a Chinese artist condemned to death by his emperor for lying , for creating pictures of a world whose beauty was contradicted by reality . But the artist cheated the emperor by painting a boat and sailing away in it .
&quot; He &apos;s at peace , &quot; they told Mary . And a hundred other cliches . The easy words of solace , except that there was no solace .
My children are going to die , Mary thought . We &apos;re all going to die . People were calmly walking the streets . Idiots , laughing , happy &#93; and they are all dying . Their hours were numbered , and they wasted them playing stupid card games and going to silly movies and pointless football games . Wake up
The answer came to her slowly , painfully , through the heavy black veils of grief . Of course they knew . Their games were a form of defiance , their laughter an act of bravado &#93; a bravado born from the knowledge that life was finite , that everyone faced the same fate ; and slowly her fear and anger melted and turned to wonder at the courage of her fellow human beings . I &apos;m ashamed of myself . I have to find my own way through the maze of time . In the end , each of us is alone , but in the meantime , we must all huddle together to give one another comfort and warmth .
She carried on conversations with him . I talked to Tim &apos;s teacher today . His grades are improving . Beth is in bed with a cold . Remember how she usually gets them this time of the year
We &apos;re all having dinner over at Florence and Douglas &apos;s tonight . They &apos;ve been wonderful , darling .
A few days later : Douglas got a promotion , darling . He was made chief of staff at the hospital .
President Paul Ellison , Stanton Rogers , and Floyd Baker were meeting in the Oval Office . The secretary of state said , &quot; Mr. President , we &apos;re both getting a lot of pressure . I don &apos;t think we can hold off any longer on naming an ambassador to Romania . I &apos;d like you to look over the list I gave you and select &#93; &quot;
&quot; Thanks , Floyd . I appreciate your efforts . I still think Mary Ashley would be ideal . Her domestic situation has changed . What was rotten luck for her may turn out to be good luck for us . I want to try her again .
&quot; This is the White House . The President is calling Mrs. Edward Ashley . &quot;
she thought . I don &apos;t want to speak to him or anyone .
She remembered how excited his call had once made her . Now it was meaningless . She said ,
Moments later the familiar voice came on the line . &quot; Mrs. Ashley , this is Paul Ellison . I just want you to know how terribly sorry we are about your husband . I understand he was a fine man . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t want to intrude on your privacy , Mrs. Ashley , and I know it &apos;s been a very short time , but now that your domestic situation has changed , I &apos;m asking you to reconsider my offer of an ambassadorship . &quot;
&quot; Hear me out , please . I &apos;m having someone fly out there to talk to you . His name is Stanton Rogers . I would appreciate it if you would at least meet with him . &quot;
She did not know what to say . How could she explain that her world had been turned upside down , that her life had been shattered
All that mattered now were Beth and Tim .
&quot; I &apos;ll meet with him , Mr. President , but I won &apos;t change my mind . &quot;
There was a popular bar on the Boulevard Bineau that Marin Groza &apos;s guards frequented when they were not on duty at the villa in Neuilly . Even Lev Pasternak occasionally visited the bar . Angel selected a table in an area of the room where conversations could be overheard . The guards , away from the rigid routine of the villa , liked to drink , and when they drank , they talked . Angel listened , seeking the villa &apos;s vulnerable point . There was always a vulnerable point . One simply had to be clever enough to find it .
It was three days before Angel overheard a conversation that gave the clue to the solution of the problem .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what Groza is doing to the whores he brings in there , but they &apos;re sure whipping the hell out of him . You should hear the screaming that goes on . Last week I got a look at the whips he keeps in his closet… &quot;
&quot; The hookers our fearless leader gets up at the villa are real beauties . They bring them in from all over the world . Lev arranges it himself . He &apos;s smart . He never uses the same girl twice . That way , no one can use the girls to get at Marin Groza . &quot;
Early the following morning , Angel changed rental cars and drove a Fiat into Paris . The sex shop was in Montmartre , on the Place Pigalle , in the middle of a section populated by whores and pimps . Angel went inside , walking slowly along the aisles , carefully studying the merchandise for sale . There were shackles and chains and iron - studded helmets , leather pants with slits in front , penis massagers and Joy Jelly , inflatable rubber dolls and porno videotapes . There were male douches and anal cream and six - foot - long braided leather whips with thongs at the end .
Angel selected a whip , paid cash for it , and left .
The following morning , Angel brought the whip back to the shop . The manager looked up and growled
&quot; I don &apos;t want a refund , &quot; Angel explained . &quot; I feel awkward carrying this around . I would appreciate it if you would mail it for me . I &apos;ll pay extra , of course . &quot;
Late that afternoon , Angel was on a plane to Buenos Aires .
The whip , carefully wrapped , arrived at the villa in Neuilly the following day . It was intercepted by the guard at the gatehouse . He read the store label on the package , opened it , and examined the whip with great care .
He passed it through , and a guard took it to Marin Groza &apos;s bedroom closet , where he placed it with the other whips .
Fort Riley , one of the oldest active army forts in the United States , was constructed in 1853 when Kansas was still referred to as Indian territory . It was built to protect wagon trains from Indian war parties . Today it is used primarily as a helicopter base and a landing field for smaller military fixedwing planes .
A limousine was standing by , waiting to drive Stanton to the Ashley home . He had telephoned Mary after the President &apos;s call .
&quot; I promise to make my visit as brief as possible , Mrs. Ashley . I plan to fly in Monday afternoon to see you , if that &apos;s all right
He &apos;s being so polite . And he &apos;s such an important man . Why is the President sending him to talk to me
&quot; It &apos;s going to be a long , boring evening , Stanton thought .
&quot; Florence , it means nothing of the kind . I promised the President I would talk to him . That &apos;s all . &quot;
&quot; I just want you to do whatever makes you happy . &quot;
Stanton Rogers was a formidable man , Mary decided . She had seen him on Meet the Press and in photographs in Time magazine , but she thought : He looks bigger in person . He was polite , but there was something distant about him .
&quot; Permit me to convey again the President &apos;s sincere regrets about your terrible tragedy , Mrs. Ashley . &quot;
She introduced him to Beth and Tim . They made small talk while Mary went into the kitchen to see how Lucinda was getting along with the dinner .
&quot; Whenever you &apos;re ready , &quot; Lucinda said .
When Mary had told Lucinda that Stanton Rogers was coming to the house for dinner and that she wanted her to make a pot roast , Lucinda had said ,
&quot; All right , &quot; Lucinda had said stubbornly , &quot; but it &apos;s the wrong dinner . &quot;
During dinner Mary and he discussed the problems of the farmers .
&quot; The farmers in the Midwest are caught in a terrible squeeze between low prices and overproduction , &quot; Mary said earnestly . &quot; They &apos;re too poor to paint , and too proud to white - wash . &quot;
They talked about the colorful history of Junction City , and Stanton Rogers finally brought the discussion around to Romania .
&quot; What is your opinion of President Ionescu &apos;s government
&quot; There is no government in Romania , in the real sense of the word , &quot; Mary replied . &quot; Ionescu is the government . He &apos;s in total control . &quot;
&quot; Do you think there will be a revolution there
&quot; Not in the present circumstances . The only man powerful enough to depose him is Marin Groza , who &apos;s in exile in France . &quot;
The questioning went on . She was an expert on the iron curtain countries , and Stanton Rogers was visibly impressed . Mary had the uncomfortable feeling that he had been examining her under a microscope all evening . She was closer to the mark than she knew .
We need the opposite of the ugly American . She &apos;s beautiful . And she and the children make an ail - American package that will sell . Stanton found himself getting more and more excited by the prospect . She can be more useful than she realizes .
&quot; Mrs. Ashley , I &apos;m going to be frank with you . Initially I was against the President appointing you to a post as sensitive as Romania . I told him as much . I tell you this now because I &apos;ve changed my mind . I think you may very well make an excellent ambassador . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m sorry , Mr. Rogers . I &apos;m no politician . I &apos;m just an amateur . &quot;
&quot; As President Ellison pointed out to me , some of our finest ambassadors have been amateurs . That is to say , their experience was not in the foreign service . Walter Annenberg , our former ambassador to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland , was a publisher . &quot;
&quot; John Kenneth Galbraith , our ambassador to India , was a professor . Mike Mansfield started out as a reporter before he became a senator and then was appointed our ambassador to Japan . I could give you a dozen more examples . These people were all what you would call amateurs . What they had , Mrs. Ashley , was intelligence , a love for their country , and goodwill toward the people of the country where they were sent to serve . &quot;
&quot; As you &apos;re probably aware , you &apos;ve already been investigated very thoroughly . You &apos;ve been approved for a security clearance , you have no problem with the IRS , and there &apos;s no conflict of interest . According to Dean Hunter you &apos;re an excellent teacher , and of course you &apos;re an expert on Romania . You &apos;ve got a running start . And last but not least , you have the kind of image the President wants to project in the iron curtain countries
&quot; Mr. Rogers , I want you and the President to know that I appreciate everything you &apos;ve said . But I couldn &apos;t accept it . I have Beth and Tim to think about . I can &apos;t just uproot them like &#93; &quot;
&quot; It would be a wonderful education for Tim and Beth to spend time in a foreign country . They &apos;d learn things they could never learn in school here . &quot;
The conversation was not going the way Mary had planned .
Stanton Rogers said . &quot; I &apos;ll be at the All Seasons Motel . Believe me , Mrs. Ashley , I know what a big decision this is for you . But this program is important not only to the President but to our country . Please think about that . &quot;
When Stanton Rogers left , Mary went upstairs . The children were waiting for her , wide awake and excited .
&quot; We have to have a talk . If I did decide to accept it , it would mean that you would have to leave school and all your friends . You would be living in a foreign country where we don &apos;t speak the language , and you would be going to a strange school . &quot;
&quot; Tim and I talked about all that , &quot; Beth said , &quot; and you know what we think
&quot; That any country would be really lucky to have you as an ambassador , Mom . &quot;
You should have heard him , darling . He made it sound as though the President really needed me . There are probably a million people who could do a better job than I could , but he was very flattering . Do you remember how you and I talked about how exciting it would be
Well , I have the chance again , and I don &apos;t know what to do . To tell you the truth , I &apos;m terrified . This is our home . How can I bear to leave it
There &apos;s so much of you here . She found that she was crying . This is all I have left of you . Help me decide . Please help me…
She sat by the window in her robe , looking out at the trees shivering in the howling , restless wind .
At nine o &apos;clock in the morning , Mary telephoned the All Seasons Motel and asked for Stanton Rogers .
&quot; Mr. Rogers , would you please tell the President that I will be honored to accept his nomination for the ambassadorship . &quot;
This one &apos;s even more beautiful than the others , the guard thought . She did not look like a prostitute . She could have been a movie actress or a model . She was in her early twenties , with long blond hair and a clear , milky complexion . She wore a designer dress .
Lev Pasternak came to the gate himself to conduct her to the house . The girl , Bisera , was a Yugoslavian , and it was her first trip to France . The sight of all the armed security guards made her nervous . I wonder what I &apos;ve gotten into
All Bisera knew was that her pimp had handed her a roundtrip plane ticket and told her she would be paid two thousand dollars for an hour &apos;s work .
Lev Pasternak knocked at a bedroom door and Groza &apos;s voice called out
Pasternak opened the door and ushered the girl inside . Marin Groza was standing at the foot of the bed . He had on a robe , and she could tell he was naked under it .
&quot; This is Bisera . &quot; He did not mention Marin Groza &apos;s name .
Pasternak left , carefully closing the door behind him , and Marin Groza was alone with the girl .
&quot; You look comfortable . Why don &apos;t I get undressed and we can both be comfortable
Groza walked over to the closet and selected a whip . &quot; I want you to use this . &quot;
So that was it . A slave fetish . Strange . He did not look the type . You never know , Bisera thought .
There was something in his expression that puzzled her , and when she realized what it was , she was even more perplexed . It was anguish . The man was in an enormous amount of pain . Why did he want to be whipped
She watched him as he walked over to a stool and sat on it .
&quot; Hard , &quot; he commanded . &quot; Whip me very hard . &quot;
&quot; Bisera picked up the long leather whip . Sadomasochism was not new to her , but there was something different here that she did not understand .
She raised the whip and cracked it down against his naked back .
He flinched with pain as the tough leather beat against his skin . Once…and twice…and again…and again , harder and harder . The vision he had been waiting for came to him then . Scenes of his wife and his daughter being raped seared through his brain . It was a gang rape , and the laughing soldiers went from the woman to the child , their pants pulled down , waiting in line for their turn . Marin Groza strained against the stool as though bound to it . As the whip fell again and again he could hear the screams of his wife and daughter begging for mercy , choking on the men &apos;s penises in their mouths , being raped and sodomized at the same time , until the blood started pouring out and their cries finally trailed off .
&quot; And with each crack of the whip he felt the sharp blade of the knife tearing into his genitals , castrating him . He was having difficulty breathing .
The girl stopped , holding the whip in midair . &quot; Hey
She watched as he toppled to the floor , his eyes open , staring at nothing .
Lev Pasternak came running in , gun in hand . He saw the figure on the floor .
I didn &apos;t do anything . I just whipped him like he told me to . I swear
The doctor , who lived in the villa , came into the room within seconds . He looked at Marin Groza &apos;s body , and bent down to examine him . The skin had turned blue and the muscles were rigid .
He picked up the whip and smelled it .
Curare . It &apos;s an extract from a South American plant . The Incas used it on darts to kill their enemies . Within three minutes the entire nervous system is paralyzed . &quot;
The two men stood there , staring helplessly at their dead leader .
The news of Marin Groza &apos;s assassination was carried all over the world by satellite . Lev Pasternak was able to keep the sordid details away from the press . In Washington , D.C. , the President had a meeting with Stanton Rogers .
&quot; Who do you think &apos;s behind it , Stan
&quot; Either the Russians or Ionescu . In the end it comes to the same thing , doesn &apos;t it
They didn &apos;t want the status quo disturbed . &quot;
&quot; So we &apos;ll be dealing with Ionescu . Very well . Let &apos;s push the Mary Ashley appointment through as quickly as possible . &quot;
On hearing the news , Angel smiled . It happened sooner than I thought .
At ten P.M. the private phone rang and the Controller picked it up .
&quot; Angel saw this mornin &apos;s paper . He say to deposit the money in his bank account . &quot;
Also tell him that I may need him again very soon . Do you have a telephone number where I can reach you
The money was deposited in the account in Zurich that morning , and one hour after it was received it was transferred to a Saudi Arabian bank in Geneva .
It was more than packing up a household . It was packing up a life . It was bidding farewell to thirteen years of dreams , memories , love . It was saying a final good - bye to Edward . This had been their home , and now it would become merely a house again , occupied by strangers with no awareness of the joys and sorrows and tears and laughter that had happened within these walls .
Douglas and Florence Schiffer were delighted that Mary had decided to accept the post .
&quot; You &apos;ll be fantastic , &quot; Florence assured Mary . &quot; Doug and I will miss you and the kids . &quot;
&quot; Promise that you &apos;ll come to Romania to visit us . &quot;
Mary was overwhelmed by the practical details that had to be taken care of , a multitude of unfamiliar responsibilities .
Call the storage company to pick up personal things that we &apos;re leaving .
An indefinite leave of absence from the university had been arranged with Dean Hunter .
&quot; I &apos;ll have someone take over your undergraduate classes . That &apos;s no problem . But your seminar students are certainly going to miss you . &quot; He smiled . &quot; I &apos;m sure you &apos;ll do us all proud , Mrs. Ashley . Good luck . &quot;
Mary withdrew the children from their school . There were travel arrangements to be made and airline tickets to be bought . In the past , Mary had taken all the financial transactions for granted because Edward had been there to handle them . Now there was no Edward , except in her mind and in her heart , where he would always be .
Mary was worried about Beth and Tim . In the beginning , they had been enthusiastic about living in a foreign country , but now that they were face - to - face with the reality , they were filled with apprehension . They each came to Mary separately .
&quot; Mother , &quot; Beth said , &quot; I can &apos;t just leave all my friends . I may never see Virgil again . Maybe I could stay here until the end of the semester . &quot;
&quot; I just got into Little League . If I go away , they &apos;ll find another third baseman . Maybe we can go after next summer , when the season &apos;s over . Please , Mom
But alone with her fears in the middle of the night , Mary thought : I don &apos;t know anything about being an ambassador . I &apos;m a Kansas housewife pretending to be some kind of statesman . Everyone &apos;s going to know I &apos;m a fraud . I was insane ever to agree to this .
Finally , miraculously , everything was ready . The house had been rented on a long lease to a family that had just moved to Junction City .
The airport where they would catch the six - passenger commuter plane to Kansas City , Missouri , was located in Manhattan , Kansas .
She walked upstairs to the bedroom she and Edward had shared for so many wonderful years . She stood there , taking a long last look .
The only thing that really bothers me is that I have a feeling we may never come back here . I feel as though I &apos;m deserting you . But you &apos;ll be with me wherever I go . I need you now more than I &apos;ve ever needed you .
Douglas Schiffer saw to it that their baggage was checked onto the little commuter plane . When Mary saw the plane sitting on the tarmac , she froze in her tracks .
Florence , I &apos;ve never been up in a plane in my life
&quot; Mary &#93; the odds are a million to one against anything happening . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t like the odds , &quot; Mary said flatly . &quot; We &apos;ll take the train . &quot;
&quot; You can &apos;t . They &apos;re expecting you in Washington this afternoon . &quot;
&quot; Alive . I &apos;m not going to be any good to them dead . &quot;
It took the Schiffers fifteen minutes to persuade Mary to board the plane . Half an hour later , she and the children were strapped aboard Air Midwest flight number 826 . As the motors revved up and the plane began racing down the runway , Mary closed her eyes and gripped the arms of her seat . Seconds later , they were airborne .
She sat rigid , refusing to look out the window , concentrating on keeping the plane in the air .
Children , Mary thought bitterly . What do they know !
At the Kansas City airport they changed to a DC - 10 and took off for Washington , D.C. Beth and Tim were seated together and Mary was across the aisle from them . An elderly lady sat next to Mary .
&quot; To tell you the truth , I &apos;m a little nervous , &quot; Mary &apos;s seatmate confessed . &quot; I &apos;ve never flown before . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s nothing to be nervous about . The odds are a million to one against anything happening . &quot;
When their plane landed at Washington &apos;s Dulles Airport , Mary and the children were met by a young man from the State Department .
&quot; Welcome to Washington , Mrs. Ashley . My name is John Burns . Mr. Rogers asked me to meet you and see that you get to your hotel safely . I &apos;ve checked you in at the Riverdale Towers . I think you &apos;ll all be comfortable there . &quot;
&quot; If you &apos;ll give me your baggage - claim checks , Mrs. Ashley , I &apos;ll see that everything is taken care of . &quot;
Twenty minutes later they were all seated in a chauffeurdriven limousine , heading toward the center of Washington .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid the children aren &apos;t very sophisticated , &quot; she apologized . &quot; You see , they &apos;ve never been away from &#93; &quot; She glanced out the window and her eyes widened .
The limousine moved up Pennsylvania Avenue , surrounded by some of the most stirring landmarks in the world . Mary thought excitedly : This is the city that rules the world . This is where the power is . And in a small way I &apos;m going to be a part of it .
Pete Connors , head of KUDESK , the counterintelligence section of the CIA , was working late , and his day was far from over . Every morning at three A.M. a team reported to prepare the President &apos;s daily intelligence checklist , collected from overnight cables . The report , code - named &quot; Pickles , &quot; had to be ready by six A.M. so that it could be on the President &apos;s desk at the start of his day . An armed courier carried the list to the White House , entering at the west gate . Pete Connors had a renewed interest in the intercepted - cable traffic coming from behind the iron curtain , because much of it concerned the appointment of Mary Ashley as the American ambassador to Romania .
The Soviet Union was worried that President Ellison &apos;s plan was a ploy to penetrate their satellite countries , to spy on them or seduce them .
The Commies aren &apos;t as worried as I am , Pete Connors thought grimly . If the President &apos;s idea works , this whole country is going to be open house for their fucking spies .
Pete Connors had been informed the moment Mary Ashley landed in Washington . He had seen photographs of her and the children .
The Riverdale Towers , one block away from the Watergate complex , is a small family hotel with comfortable , nicely decorated suites .
A bellman brought up the luggage , and as Mary started unpacking , the telephone rang . Mary picked it up .
&quot; My name is Ben Cohn . I &apos;m a reporter with The Washington Post . I wonder if we could talk for a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; It will only take five minutes . I really just wanted to say hello . &quot;
Ben Cohn was short and stocky , with a muscular body and the battered face of a prizefighter . He looks like a sports reporter , Mary thought .
She noticed that he had no notebook or tape recorder .
Whenever a celebrity steps off an airplane somewhere , the first thing they &apos;re asked is , How do you like this place
&quot; I &apos;m not a celebrity , but I think I &apos;m going to like Washington a lot . &quot;
&quot; You were a professor at Kansas State University
&quot; Yes . I taught a course called Eastern Europe : Today &apos;s Politics . &quot;
&quot; I understand that the President first learned about you when he read a book of yours on Eastern Europe and several of your magazine articles . &quot;
&quot; And the rest , as they say , is history . &quot;
&quot; I suppose it is an unusual way to &#93; &quot;
&quot; Not that unusual . Jeane Kirkpatrick came to President Reagan &apos;s attention in the same way , and he made her ambassador to the UN. &quot; He smiled at her . &quot; So you see , there &apos;s precedent . That &apos;s one of the big buzzwords in Washington . Precedent . Your grandparents were Romanian
Ben Cohn stayed for another fifteen minutes , getting information on Mary &apos;s background .
&quot; When will this interview appear in the paper
&quot; She wanted to be sure to send copies to Florence and Douglas and her other friends back home .
Ben Cohn rose and said evasively , &quot; I &apos;m going to save it for now . &quot; There was something about the situation that puzzled him . The problem was that he was not sure what it was . &quot; We &apos;ll be talking again later . &quot;
&quot; Yes . &quot; She hesitated , unsure . &quot; I think so . &quot;
It was like hearing the voice of an old friend . Maybe it &apos;s because he &apos;s the only person in town I know , Mary thought . &quot; Good morning , Mr. Rogers . Thank you for having Mr. Burns meet us at the airport , and for arranging our hotel . &quot;
&quot; I thought it would be a good idea if we met to discuss some of the procedures you &apos;ll be going through . &quot;
&quot; Why don &apos;t we make it lunch today at the Grand
&quot; I &apos;ll meet you in the downstairs dining room . &quot;
Mary arranged for the children to have room service , and at one o &apos;clock a taxi dropped her off at the Grand Hotel . Mary looked at it in awe . The Grand Hotel is its own center of power . Heads of state and diplomats from all over the world stay there , and it is easy to see why . It is an elegant building , with an imposing lobby that has Italian marble floors and gracious columns under a circular ceiling .
&quot; That sounds so formal . What about Stan and Mary
Stanton Rogers seemed different somehow , and the change was hard for Mary to define . In Junction City there had been an aloofness about him , almost a resentment toward her . Now that seemed to have completely vanished . He was warm and friendly . The difference is that he &apos;s accepted me
They ordered lunch . The entrees seemed very expensive to her . It &apos;s not like the prices in Junction City . Her hotel suite was $ 250 a day .
&quot; Stan , I don &apos;t want to seem rude , but can you tell me how much an ambassador is paid
Your salary will be sixty - five thousand dollars a year , plus a housing allowance . &quot;
Her heart sank . That would not even take care of her hotel bill , let alone all the other expenses .
&quot; About a month . We &apos;ll do everything we can to expedite your move . The secretary of state has cabled the Romanian government for approval of your appointment . Just between us , there have already been private discussions between the two governments . There will be no problem with the Romanians , but you still have to pass the Senate . &quot;
So the Romanian government is going to accept me , Mary thought wonderingly . Perhaps I &apos;m better qualified than I realized .
&quot; I &apos;ve set up an informal consultation for you with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . The next step after that will be an open hearing of the full committee . They &apos;ll ask you questions about your background , your loyalty to this country , your perceptions of the job , and what you hope to accomplish . &quot;
&quot; The committee votes , and when they turn in their report , the full Senate votes . &quot;
&quot; Nominations have been voted down in the past , haven &apos;t they
&quot; The President &apos;s prestige is on the line with this one . You &apos;ll have the full backing of the White House . The President is eager to push your appointment through as quickly as possible . Incidentally , I thought you and the children might like to do some sight - seeing in the next few days , so I &apos;ve arranged for a car and driver for you , and a private tour of the White House . &quot;
The private tour of the White House was arranged for the following morning . A guide escorted them around . They were taken through the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden and the eighteenth - century - style American garden containing a pool , trees , and herbs for use in the White House kitchen .
&quot; Just ahead , &quot; the guide announced , &quot; is the East Wing . It houses military offices , congressional liaisons to the President , a visitor &apos;s office , and offices of the First Lady &apos;s staff . &quot;
They went through the West Wing and looked into the President &apos;s Oval Office .
&quot; There are one hundred and thirty - two rooms , sixty - nine closets , twenty - eight fireplaces , and thirty - two bathrooms . &quot;
&quot; They sure must go to the bathroom a lot . &quot;
&quot; President Washington helped supervise much of the construction of the White House . He is the only President who never resided here . &quot;
The tour took almost two hours , and by the end of it the Ashley family was exhausted and impressed .
This is where it all began , Mary thought . And now I &apos;m going to be a part of it .
The call from the President &apos;s office came the following morning .
&quot; Good morning , Mrs. Ashley . President Ellison wonders whether you could make yourself available this afternoon to meet with him
&quot; A limousine will be downstairs for you at two forty - five . &quot;
Paul Ellison rose as Mary was ushered into the Oval Office . He walked over to shake her hand , grinned , and said
&quot; It &apos;s a kind of identical spirit of a living person . &quot;
&quot; Right . And that &apos;s us . I can &apos;t tell you how excited I was when I read your latest article , Mary . It was as though I were reading something I had written . There are a lot of people who don &apos;t believe our people - to - people plan can work , but you and I are going to fool them . &quot;
Our people - to - people plan . We &apos;re going to fool them . He &apos;s a charmer , Mary thought . Aloud , she said
&quot; I &apos;m counting on you . Very heavily . Romania is the testing ground . Since Groza was assassinated , your job is going to be more difficult . If we can pull it off there , we can make it work in the other Communist countries . &quot;
&quot; Stan Rogers will keep in close touch with you . He &apos;s become a big fan of yours .
&quot; You have an appointment at nine o &apos;clock tomorrow morning with the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . &quot;
The Committee on Foreign Relations has offices in the Dirksen Building . A plaque in the hallway at the right side of the door reads : COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS SD - 419 .
The chairman was a rotund , gray - haired man with sharp green eyes and the easy manner of a professional politician .
&quot; Charlie Campbell . It &apos;s a pleasure to meet you , Mrs. Ashley . I &apos;ve certainly been hearing a lot about you . &quot;
&quot; No , thank you , Senator . &quot; She was too nervous to hold a cup in her hand .
&quot; Well , then , let &apos;s get right down to business . The President is eager to have you represent us in Romania . Naturally , we all want to give him our full support in every way possible . The question is &#93; do you think you &apos;re qualified to handle that position , Mrs. Ashley
Her answer caught him off guard .
&quot; If you mean have I had any diplomatic experience in dealing with foreign countries , then I &apos;m not qualified . However , I &apos;ve been told that one third of the country &apos;s ambassadors are also people without previous experience . What I would bring to my job is a knowledge of Romania . I &apos;m familiar with its economic and sociological problems and with its political background . I believe I could project a positive image of our country to the Romanians . &quot;
I expected a bubblehead . In fact , Campbell had resented Mary Ashley even before meeting her . He had been given orders from the top to see that Mary Ashley got his committee &apos;s approval no matter what they thought of her . A lot of snickering was going on in the corridors of power about what a gaffe the President had made by selecting an unknown hayseed from a place called Junction City , Kansas . But , by God , Campbell thought , I think the boys may be in for a little surprise .
&quot; The full Hearing Committee meets at nine o &apos;clock Wednesday morning . &quot;
Darling , when they question me about my experience , what am I going to tell them
That in Junction City I was homecoming queen , and that I won the ice - skating contest three years in a row
I &apos;m panicky . Oh , how I wish you were here with me .
But once again the irony struck her . If Edward were alive , she would not be here . I &apos;d be safe and warm at home with my husband and children , where I belong .
The hearing was held in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee room , with the full fifteen members of the committee present , seated at a dais in front of a wall that held four large world maps . Along the left side of the room was the press table , filled with reporters , and in the center , seats for two hundred spectators . The corners were brightly lighted for television cameras . The room was filled to overflowing . Pete Connors sat in a back row . There was a sudden hush as Mary entered with Beth and Tim .
Mary was wearing a dark tailored suit and a white blouse . The children had been forced out of their jeans and sweaters and were in their Sunday best .
Ben Cohn , seated at the press table , watched as they came in .
An attendant seated the children in a front row , and Mary was escorted to the witness chair facing the committee . She sat under the glare of the hot lights , trying to conceal her nervousness .
&quot; Good morning , Mrs. Ashley . We thank you for appearing before this committee . We will proceed to the questions . &quot;
They started innocently enough .
The questions were gentle and supportive .
&quot; According to the biography we &apos;ve been furnished , Mrs. Ashley , for the last several years you &apos;ve taught political science at Kansas State University . Is that correct
&quot; Your grandparents were Romanian
&quot; My grandfather . Yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;ve written a book and articles on rapprochement between the United States and Soviet - bloc countries
&quot; The latest article was printed in Foreign Affairs magazine and came to the attention of the President
&quot; That &apos;s my understanding . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ashley , would you kindly tell this committee what the basic premise of your article is
Her nervousness was rapidly disappearing . She was on sure ground now , discussing a subject on which she was an authority . She felt as though she were conducting a seminar at school .
&quot; Several regional economic pacts currently exist in the world , and because they are mutually exclusive , they serve to divide the world into antagonistic and competitive blocs , instead of uniting it . Europe has the Common Market , the Eastern Bloc has COMECON , and then there is the OECD , consisting of the free market countries , and the nonaligned movement of Third World states . My premise is very simple : I would like to see all the various and discrete organizations linked together by economic ties . Individuals who are engaged in a profitable partnership don &apos;t kill one another . I believe that the same principle applies to countries . I would like to see our country spearhead a movement to form a common market that includes allies and adversaries alike . Today , as an example , we &apos;re paying billions of dollars to store surplus grain in grain elevators while people in dozens of countries are starving .
&quot; I &apos;d like to ask the nominee a few questions . &quot;
Ben Cohn leaned forward in his seat .
Senator Turkel was in his seventies , tough and abrasive , a noted curmudgeon . &quot; Is this your first time in Washington , Mrs. Ashley
&quot; I suppose you &apos;ve done a good deal of traveling
&quot; Have you ever been to New York
&quot; Have you , in fact , ever been outside the state of Kansas , Mrs. Ashley
&quot; Yes . I gave a lecture at the University of Chicago and a series of talks in Denver and Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; That must have been very exciting for you , Mrs. Ashley . I can &apos;t recall when this committee has been asked to approve a less - qualified candidate for an ambassadorial post . You expect to represent the United States of America in a sensitive iron curtain country , and you &apos;re telling us that your entire knowledge of the world comes from living in Junction City , Kansas , and spending a few days in Chicago , Denver , and Atlanta . Is that true
&quot; No , sir . My knowledge of the world comes from studying it . I have a Ph . D. in political science and I &apos;ve been teaching at Kansas State University for five years , with an emphasis on the iron curtain countries . I &apos;m familiar with the current problems of the Romanian people and what their government thinks of the United States , and why . &quot; Her voice was stronger now . &quot; All they know about this country is what their propaganda machines tell them . I would like to go over there and try to convince them that the United States is not a greedy , war - hungry country . I would like to show them what a typical American family is like . I &#93; &quot;
She broke off , afraid she had gone too far in her anger . And then , to her surprise , the members of the committee started to applaud . All except Turkel .
&quot; I think the nominee has expressed herself very clearly , &quot; one of the senators commented .
&quot; I agree . Thank you , Mrs. Ashley . This session is adjourned . &quot;
Pete Connors studied Mary thoughtfully a moment , then quietly left as the members of the press swarmed around her .
&quot; Was the President &apos;s appointment a surprise to you
&quot; Do you think they &apos;re going to approve your appointment , Mrs. Ashley
&quot; Do you really believe that teaching about a country qualifies you to &#93;
&quot; Turn this way , Mrs. Ashley . Smile , please . One more . &quot;
She &apos;s good , he thought . She has all the right answers . I wish to hell I knew the right questions .
When Mary arrived back at the hotel , emotionally drained , Stanton Rogers was on the telephone .
Thank you so much . I can &apos;t tell you how excited I am . &quot;
&quot; His voice was filled with pride .
When Mary told the children , they hugged her .
Monday morning she ran into Mike Slade in the hallway . He grinned and said
&quot; I hear you kept half of Washington up Saturday night . &quot;
His supercilious air infuriated her . She brushed past him and went into James Stickley &apos;s office .
&quot; Mr. Stickley , I really don &apos;t think it would serve the best interests of our embassy in Romania for Mr. Slade and me to try working together . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s his &#93; his attitude . I find Mr. Slade to be rude and arrogant . Frankly , I don &apos;t like Mr. Slade . &quot;
He &apos;s a rhinestone in the rough . I &apos;m officially requesting that you send someone else in his place . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ashley , Mike Slade happens to be our top field expert on East European affairs . Your job is to make friends with the natives . My job is to see to it that you get all the help I can give you . And his name is Mike Slade . I really don &apos;t want to hear any more about it .
She returned to her office , frustrated and angry . I could talk to Stan , she thought . He would understand . But that would be a sign of weakness . I &apos;m going to have to handle Mike Slade myself .
Mary looked up , startled . Mike Slade was standing in front of her desk , holding a large stack of memos .
&quot; Knock next time you want to come into my office . &quot;
His eyes were mocking her . &quot; Why do I get the feeling you &apos;re not crazy about me
She felt her temper rising again . &quot; I &apos;ll tell you why , Mr. Slade . Because I think you &apos;re an arrogant , nasty , conceited &#93; &quot;
&quot; Don &apos;t you dare make fun of me . &quot; She found herself yelling .
What do you think everyone in Washington is saying about you
&quot; I don &apos;t really care what they &apos;re saying . &quot;
&quot; Oh , but you should . &quot; He leaned over her desk . &quot; Everybody is asking what right you have to be sitting at an ambassador &apos;s desk . I spent four years in Romania , lady . It &apos;s a piece of dynamite ready to explode , and the government is sending in a dumb kid from the sticks to play with it . &quot;
&quot; You &apos;re an amateur , Mrs. Ashley . If someone wanted to pay you off , they should have made you ambassador to Iceland . &quot;
Mary lost control . She sprang to her feet and slapped him hard across the face .
The invitation read : &quot; The Ambassador of the Socialist Republic of Romania requests your presence for cocktails and dinner at the Embassy , 1607 23rd Street , N.W. , at 7 : 30 P.M. , Black Tie , RSVP 555 - 6593 . &quot;
Mary thought of the last time she had visited that embassy and what a fool she had made of herself . Well , that won &apos;t happen again . I &apos;m past all that . I &apos;m part of the Washington scene now .
She put on one of the new outfits she had bought , a black cut - velvet evening dress with long sleeves . She wore black silk high - heeled pumps , and a simple pearl necklace .
&quot; I &apos;m overwhelmed . You two have dinner in the dining room downstairs and then you may come up and watch television . I &apos;ll be home early . Tomorrow we &apos;re all going to visit President Washington &apos;s home at Mount Vernon . &quot;
The telephone rang . It was the desk clerk . &quot; Madam Ambassador , Mr. Stickley is waiting for you in the lobby . &quot;
I wish I could have gone alone , Mary thought . I don &apos;t need him or anyone else to keep me out of trouble .
The Romanian embassy looked completely different from the last time Mary had seen it . There was a festive air about it that had been totally missing on her first visit . They were greeted at the door by Gabriel Stoica , the deputy chief of mission .
There was no flicker of recognition on Stoica &apos;s face .
As they walked down the hallway , Mary noticed that all the rooms were brightly lighted and well heated . From upstairs she could hear the strains of a small orchestra . There were vases of flowers everywhere .
Ambassador Corbescue was talking to a group of people when he saw James Stickley and Mary Ashley approach .
&quot; Good evening , Ambassador . May I present the United States ambassador to Romania
Mary waited for the twinkle in his eye .
There were a hundred people at dinner . The men wore dinner jackets and the women were beautifully gowned in dresses by Givenchy , Oscar de la Renta , and Louis Estevēs . The large table Mary had seen upstairs on her earlier visit had been augmented by half a dozen smaller tables around it . Liveried butlers circled the room with trays of champagne .
&quot; Because it &apos;s part of the job . At every diplomatic dinner party you attend , there will be toasts . If you don &apos;t drink , you &apos;ll offend your host . You have to take a sip now and then . &quot;
She looked across the room , and there was Mike Slade . She did not recognize him for a moment . He was wearing a dinner jacket , and she had to admit that he was not unattractive in evening clothes . His arm was draped over a voluptuous blonde who was about to fall out of her dress . Cheap , Mary thought . Just his taste . I wonder how many girl friends he has waiting for him in Bucharest ?
Mary remembered Mike &apos;s words : You &apos;re an amateur , Mrs. Ashley . If someone wanted to pay you off , he should have made you ambassador to Iceland . The bastard .
As Mary watched , Colonel McKinney , in full dress uniform , walked up to Mike . Mike excused himself from the blonde and walked over to a corner with the colonel . I &apos;m going to have to watch them both , Mary thought .
&quot; A lot of business gets done at these parties . That &apos;s why embassies give them . &quot;
Mary spent the next hour being introduced to ambassadors , senators , governors , and some of Washington &apos;s most powerful political figures . Romania had become a hot ticket , and nearly everyone of importance had managed to get an invitation to the embassy dinner . Mike Slade approached James Stickley and Mary , holding the blonde in tow .
Miss Dennison &apos;s father happens to be an ambassador too . He &apos;s a career diplomat , of course . He &apos;s served in half a dozen countries for the last twenty - five years . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s a wonderful way to grow up . &quot;
Mary prayed she would not be seated next to Mike at dinner , and her prayers were granted . He was at another table , next to the half - naked blonde . There were a dozen people at Mary &apos;s table . Some of them were familiar faces she had seen on magazine covers and on television . James Stickley was seated across from Mary . The man to Mary &apos;s left spoke a mysterious language that she was unable to identify . To her right was a tall , thin , middle - aged blond man , with an attractive , sensitive face .
&quot; I am delighted to be your dinner companion , &quot; he said to Mary . &quot; I am an ardent fan of yours . &quot; He spoke with a slight Scandinavian accent .
&quot; I am Olaf Peterson . I am the cultural attaché from Sweden . &quot;
&quot; No . To tell you the truth , I really haven &apos;t been anywhere . &quot;
&quot; Then so many places have a treat in store for them . &quot;
&quot; Perhaps one day the children and I will visit your country . &quot;
&quot; Tim is ten and Beth is twelve . I &apos;ll show you .
&quot; Mary opened her purse and took out snapshots of the children . Across the table , James Stickley was shaking his head disapprovingly .
&quot; I said I read about your husband being killed in a motor accident . I am sorry . It must be very difficult for a woman to be alone without a man .
Mary picked up the glass of wine in front of her and took a sip . It was cold and refreshing . She drained the glass . It was immediately refilled by a white - gloved waiter hovering behind the guests .
&quot; I was told we &apos;ll be leaving within the next few weeks . &quot; Mary picked up her wineglass . &quot; To Bucharest . &quot; She drank . The wine was really quite delicious , and everyone knew that wine had a low alcohol content .
When the waiter offered to fill her glass again , she nodded happily . She looked around the room at all the beautifully dressed guests speaking in a dozen different tongues and thought : They don &apos;t have banquets like this in good old Junction City .
He motioned to the waiter , and Mary &apos;s wineglass was refilled .
&quot; At home , &quot; Mary said confidentially , &quot; I never drank wine . &quot; She lifted her glass and took a swallow . &quot; In fact , I never drank anything . &quot; Her words were beginning to slur . &quot; That doesn &apos; &apos;clude water , of course . &quot;
&quot; Ladies and gentlemen &#93; distinguished guests &#93; I would like to propose a toast . &quot;
The ritual began . There were toasts to Alexandros Ionescu , the President of Romania . There were toasts to Madam Alexandros Ionescu . There were toasts to the President of the United States , and to the Vice - President , to the Romanian flag and to the American flag . It seemed to Mary that there were thousands of toasts . She drank to every one of them .
&quot; I am sure we would all like to hear a few words from the United States &apos; charming new ambassador to Romania . &quot;
Mary raised her glass and started to drink a toast , when she suddenly realized she was being called upon .
She had never felt happier in her life . Everyone in the room was so friendly . They were all smiling at her . Some were even laughing . She looked over at James Stickley and grinned .
&quot; It &apos;s a great party , &quot; Mary said . &quot; I &apos;m delighted you could all come . &quot; She sat down heavily and turned to Olaf Peterson .
&quot; They put somethin &apos; in my wine . &quot; He pressed her hand . &quot; I think what you need is a little fresh air . It is very stuffy in here . &quot;
&quot; Yeah . Stuffy . To tell you the truth , I &apos;m feelin &apos; a li &apos;l dizzy . &quot;
He helped Mary to her feet , and to her surprise , she found it difficult to walk . James Stickley was engaged in an earnest conversation with his dinner partner and did not see Mary leave . Mary and Olaf Peterson passed Mike Slade &apos;s table , and he was watching her with a frown of disapproval .
He wan &apos;sa be ambassador . He can &apos;t stand it that I got the job . &quot;
Mary was grateful for the support of Peterson &apos;s arm . Everything seemed blurred .
Brandy . In books , all the sophisticated people drank brandy . Brandy and soda . It was a Cary Grant kind of drink .
Olaf Peterson helped Mary into a taxi and gave the driver an address . When they stopped in front of a large apartment building , Mary looked at Peterson , puzzled .
Peterson led her into the lobby of the building and rang for the elevator .
The elevator door opened , and Peterson helped Mary out of the elevator .
He held her up with one hand while he fumbled for the key to his apartment and unlocked the door . They stepped inside .
He led her to the couch and sat her down . She was feeling giddy . His lips pressed against hers , and she felt his hand sliding up her thigh .
Edward &apos;s hands . Mary closed her eyes and felt his lips moving down her body &#93; soft lips , and a gentle tongue . Edward had such a gentle tongue . And she wanted it never to stop .
&quot; I will . Now . &quot; His voice was husky . Suddenly harsh . Not at all like Edward &apos;s voice .
Mary opened her eyes , and she was staring into the face of a stranger . As she felt the man start to thrust inside her , she screamed , &quot; No
She walked down the deserted streets , bracing herself against the icy wind , filled with a deep , bruising mortification . There was no explanation for what she had done . And there was no excuse . She had disgraced her position . And in what a stupid way
She had gotten drunk in front of half the diplomatic corps in Washington , had gone to a stranger &apos;s apartment , and had almost let him seduce her . In the morning she was going to be the target for every gossip columnist in Washington .
Ben Cohn heard the story from three people who had attended the dinner at the Romanian embassy . He searched through the columns of the Washington and New York newspapers . There was not one word about the incident . Someone had killed the story . It had to be someone very important .
Cohn sat in the small cubicle that the newspaper called an office , thinking . He dialed Ian Villiers &apos;s number . &quot; Hello , is Mr. Villiers in
&quot; One moment , please . &quot; She was back on the line one minute later . &quot; I &apos;m terribly sorry , Mr. Cohn . Mr. Villiers seems to have stepped out . &quot;
&quot; He replaced the receiver and dialed the number of a gossip columnist who worked on another newspaper . Nothing happened in Washington without her knowing it .
&quot; Anything exciting happening around this gilded watering hole
&quot; I understand the Romanian embassy had a big wingding last night . &quot;
&quot; No . I &apos;ve got to go now , Ben . I have a long - distance call . &quot;
He dialed the number of a friend in the State Department . When the secretary put him through , he said
&quot; It &apos;s been a long time . I thought we might get together for lunch . &quot;
&quot; Fair enough . My calendar is pretty light today . Do you want to meet me at the Watergate
&quot; Why don &apos;t we make it Mama Regina &apos;s in Silver Spring
Ben Cohn was seated at a table in the corner when his guest , Alfred Shuttleworth , arrived . The host , Tony Sergio , seated him .
Alfred Shuttleworth was a sallow - looking middle - aged man who worked in the European section of the State Department . A few years earlier , he had been involved in a drunk - driving accident that Ben Cohn had covered for his newspaper . Shuttleworth &apos;s career was at stake . Cohn had killed the story , and Shuttleworth showed his appreciation by giving him news tips from time to time .
&quot; I &apos;d like the inside information on our new ambassador to Romania . &quot;
&quot; Three people called to tell me that she got so stoned at the Romanian ambassador &apos;s party last night that she made a horse &apos;s ass of herself in front of Washington &apos;s who &apos;s who . Have you seen the morning papers today , or the early editions of the afternoon papers
&quot; Yes . They mentioned the embassy party , but there was no mention of Mary Ashley . &quot;
&quot; Sherlock Holmes . The dog didn &apos;t bark . It was silent . So are the newspapers . Why would the gossip columnists skip over a juicy story like that
Someone had that story killed . Someone important . If it had been any other VIP who publicly disgraced herself , the press would have had a Roman holiday . &quot;
&quot; Al , there &apos;s this Cinderella who comes out of nowhere , is touched by the magic wand of our President , and suddenly becomes Grace Kelly , Princess Di , and Jacqueline Kennedy rolled into one . Now , I &apos;ll admit the lady is pretty &#93; but she isn &apos;t that pretty . The lady is bright &#93; but she isn &apos;t that bright . In my humble opinion , teaching a political science course at Kansas State University doesn &apos;t exactly qualify anyone to be the ambassador to one of the world &apos;s hot spots .
I &apos;ll tell you something else that &apos;s out of kilter . I flew to Junction City and talked to the sheriff there . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ashley turned down the President because her husband couldn &apos;t leave his medical practice . Then he was killed in a convenient auto accident .
&quot; I &apos;m not suggesting anything . Let me tell you what Sheriff Munster suggested . He thought it was peculiar that half a dozen witnesses showed up out of nowhere in the middle of a freezing winter night just in time to witness the accident . And do you want to hear something even more peculiar
&quot; I went over to Fort Riley to talk to the driver of the army truck that killed Dr . Ashley . &quot;
&quot; Not much . He was dead . Heart attack . Twenty - seven years old . &quot;
&quot; Oh , yes . There &apos;s more . I went over to the CID office at Fort Riley to interview Colonel Jenkins , the officer in charge of the army investigation as well as being one of the witnesses to the accident . The colonel wasn &apos;t there . He &apos;s been promoted and transferred . He &apos;s a major general now , overseas somewhere . No one seems to know where . &quot;
&quot; Ben , I know you &apos;re a hell of a reporter , but I honestly think this time you &apos;ve gone off the track . You &apos;re building a few coincidences into a Hitchcock scenario . People do get killed in auto accidents , people do have heart attacks , and officers do get promoted . You &apos;re looking for some kind of conspiracy where there is none . &quot;
&quot; Al , have you heard of an organization called Patriots for Freedom
&quot; It &apos;s nothing like the DAR. I keep hearing rumors , but there &apos;s nothing I can pin down . &quot;
&quot; It &apos;s supposed to be a cabal of high - level right - wing and left - wing fanatics from a dozen Eastern and Western countries . Their ideologies are diametrically opposed , but what brings them together is fear . The Communist members think President Ellison &apos;s plan is a capitalist trick to destroy the Eastern bloc . The right - wingers believe his plan is an open door that will let the Communists destroy us . So they &apos;ve formed this unholy alliance . &quot;
&quot; There &apos;s more . Besides the VIPs , splinter groups from various international security agencies are said to be involved . Do you think you could check it out for me
&quot; I would suggest you do it discreetly . If the organization really exists , they won &apos;t be too thrilled to have anyone nosing around . &quot;
Alfred Shuttleworth was skeptical about Ben Cohn &apos;s theory . Reporters are always looking for sensational angles , Shuttleworth thought . He liked Ben Cohn , but Shuttleworth had no idea how to go about tracking down a probably mythical organization . If it really did exist , it would be in some government computer . He himself had no access to the computers . But I know someone who does , Alfred Shuttleworth remembered . I &apos;ll give him a call .
Alfred Shuttleworth was on his second martini when Pete Connors walked into the bar .
&quot; There &apos;s a coffee shop downstairs in your building . Why don &apos;t we meet there
Now she was at the party , and she wished she were home with Beth and Tim . The faces at her table were unfamiliar . On her right was a Greek shipping magnate . On her left was an English diplomat .
&quot; I &apos;ve never been to Middle America , but I imagine it must be dreadful . All those farmers and nothing but dreary fields of corn and wheat . It &apos;s a wonder you could bear it as long as you did . &quot;
Mary felt a surge of anger , but she kept her voice under control . &quot; That corn and wheat you &apos;re talking about , &quot; she said politely , &quot; feeds the world . &quot;
&quot; Our automobiles run on gasoline , but I wouldn &apos;t want to live in the oil fields . Culturally speaking , I think one has to live in the East , don &apos;t you
I &apos;ll finish this contract and get back home . The job is simple , almost an insult to my talent . But the money is excellent .
I &apos;ve got to get laid tonight . I wonder why killing always makes me horny . Angel &apos;s first stop was at an electrical supply store , then a paint store , and finally a supermarket , where Angel &apos;s only purchase was six light bulbs .
